BCNF requires that there be no non-trivial functional dependencies of attributes on something other than a superset of a candidate key (called a superkey). At this stage, all attributes are dependent on a key, a whole key and nothing but a key (excluding trivial dependencies, like A->A). A table is said to be in the BCNF if and only if it is in the 3NF and every non-trivial, left-irreducible functional dependency has a candidate key as its determinant. In more informal terms, a table is in BCNF if it is in 3NF and the only determinants are the candidate keys.

The root pointer points to the topmost node in the tree. The left and right pointers recursively point to smaller subtrees on either side. One common use of binary trees is binary search trees; another is binary heaps. 
Binding Time	Binding Time - Binding Time is the time at which decisions are made. In software programing, there are different types of binding times. Static or early binding happens at compile time and certain type information is used and sometimes then thrown away; dynamic binding or late or virtual binding happens at run time. An example of a static binding is a direct C function call: the function referenced by the identifier cannot change at runtime. An example of dynamic binding is dynamic dispatch, as in a C++ virtual method call.

Boolean Algebra	Boolean Algebra - Boolean algebra is an algebraic structure (a collection of elements and operations on them obeying defining axioms) that captures essential properties of both set operations and logic operations. Specifically, it deals with the set operations of intersection, union, complement; and the logic operations of AND, OR, NOT. A Boolean algebra is also called a Boolean lattice. 
Boolean AND	Boolean AND - Boolean AND is one of the operations in the Boolean algebra that is performed on a pair of one-digit binary numbers. The result is another one-digit binary number. For example, 1 AND 1 yields 1; all other combinations yield 0. 
Boolean logic	Boolean logic - Boolean logic is a complete system for logical operations. It was named after George Boole, an English mathematician in the mid-19th century. Boolean logic has many applications in electronics, computer hardware and software. For example, in circuit design in electrical engineering, 0 and 1 may represent the two different states of one bit in a digital circuit, typically high and low voltage. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables if, and only if, the corresponding circuits have the same input-output behavior. Furthermore, every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression. Basic logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT gates may be used alone, or in conjunction with NAND, NOR, and XOR gates, to control digital electronics and circuitry. 
Boolean OR	Boolean OR - Boolean OR is one of the operations in the Boolean algebra that is performed on a pair of one-digit binary numbers. The result is another one-digit binary number. For example, 0 OR 0 yields 0; All other combinations yield 1. 
Boolean value	Boolean value - Boolean value, also known as boolean datatype, is a primitive datatype having two values: one and zero (sometimes called true and false). It is the special case of a binary numeric datatype of only one digit, or bit, and can also be represented in any other radix by restricting the range of allowed values for certain operations. This datatype is used in boolean and other operations such as: and (AND, &, *), or (OR, |, +), exclusive or/not equivalent (xor, NEQV, ^), equal (EQV, =, ==) and not (NOT, ~, ;!) which correspond to some of the operations of Boolean algebra and arithmetic.

Bottom-up Design	Bottom-up Design - Bottom-up design, in contrast to the top down design, is one of the software design strategies in which individual parts of the system are specified in detail. The parts are then linked together to form larger components, which are in turn linked until a complete system is formed. Strategies based on this bottom-up information flow seem potentially necessary and sufficient because they are based on the knowledge of all variables that may affect the elements of the system. 
Bounds-Checking Elimination	Bounds-Checking Elimination - Bounds-checking elimination is a compiler optimization useful in programming languages or runtimes that enforce bounds checking, the practice of consistently checking every index into an array to verify that the index is within the defined valid range of indexes. Its goal is to detect which of these indexing operations do not need to be validated at runtime, and eliminating those checks.

Xinu, Dynix) held the technical lead in the Unix world. 
BSP: Board Support Package	BSP: Board Support Package - Board support package(BSP) is part of a software package that is processor or platform dependent. Typically, sample source code for the BSP for various processors is provided by the software package developer. To port the complete software package, the code in the sample BSP should be modified. Most commercial real-time operating systems have a BSP to make porting easy. 
BSS: Block Started by Symbol	BSS: Block Started by Symbol - Block Started by Symbol (BSS) was a pseudo-instruction in UA-SAP (United Aircraft Symbolic Assembly Program), and the assembler was developed in the mid-1950s for the IBM 704. The BSS keyword was later incorporated into FAP (FORTRAN Assembly Program), IBM's standard assembler for its 709 and 7090/94 computers. It defined a label and reserved uninitialized space for a given number of words. In computer programming, .bss or bss is used by many compilers and linkers as the name of the data segment containing uninitialized variables. It is often referred to as the bss section or bss segment. 
BST: Binary Search Tree	BST: Binary Search Tree - A binary search tree (BST), also called ordered binary tree, is a type of binary tree where the nodes are arranged in order: for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less-or-equal to the node (<=), and all the elements in its right subtree are greater than the node (>). BST has the following properties:1. Each node has a value. 2. A total order is defined on these values. 3. The left subtree of a node contains only values less than the node's value. 4. The right subtree of a node contains only values greater than or equal to the node's value. 5. The major advantage of binary search trees is that the related sorting algorithms and search algorithms such as in-order traversal can be very efficient.
Budget Range	Budget Range - Budget range is the name given to software (usually video games) that is sold for a fraction (usually less than half) of a regular product price. While most of the software released under budget range are re-releases of successful products (such as Sony's Platinum range), other labels (usually smaller, localized or value labels of larger companies) release their new games at budget prices to gather a broader audience. 
Bug	Bug - In computer programming, a bug, also called software bug, is an error, flaw, mistake, failure, or fault in a computer program that prevents it from working as intended, or produces an incorrect result. Bugs arise from mistakes and errors, made by people, in either a program's source code or its design. A program that contains a large number of bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy. Reports about bugs in a program are referred to as bug reports, also called PRs (problem reports), trouble reports, CRs (change requests), and so forth.

Byte-Code	Byte-Code - Byte-code is a binary file containing an executable program, formed by a sequence of op code/data pairs. Byte-code is a sort of intermediate code that is more abstract than machine code. It is often treated as a binary file containing an executable program, much like an object module. Byte-code is called so because usually each opcode is one byte in length but the length of instruction code varies. Each instruction has one byte operation code from 0 to 255 (or as hexadecimal: 00 to FF) followed by parameters such as registers or memory address. This is a typical case, but the specification of bytecode largely varies in language. 
Bzip2	Bzip2 - Bzip2 is an open source data compression algorithm and program developed by Julian Seward in 1996. The compressor's stability and popularity grew over the next several years, and Seward released version 1.0 in late 2000.

The first major program written in C was the UNIX operating system. It has since spread to many other operating systems. Although originally designed as a systems programming language, C has proved to be a powerful and flexible language that can be used for a variety of applications, from business programs to engineering. C is a particularly popular language for personal computer programmers because it is relatively small -- it requires less memory than other languages. 
C#	C# - C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of their .NET initiative, and later approved as a standard by ECMA and ISO. C# has a procedural, object oriented syntax based on C++ that includes aspects of several other programming languages (most notably Delphi, Visual Basic, and Java) with a particular emphasis on simplification (fewer symbolic requirements than C++, fewer decorative requirements than Java). 
C++	C++ - C++, originally named C with Classes, is a high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. C++ adds object-oriented features to its predecessor, C. C++ is a statically-typed free-form multi-paradigm language supporting procedural programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming.

Within CAID programs designers have the freedom of creativity, but typically follow a simple design methodology: - Creating sketches, using a stylus Generating surfaces directly from the curves 
Callback	Callback - In computer programming, a callback is executable code that is passed as an argument to other code. It allows a lower-level software layer to call a function defined in a higher-level layer. Usually, the higher-level code starts by calling a function within the lower-level code passing to it a pointer or handle to another function. While the lower-level function executes, it may call the passed-in function any number of times to perform some subtask. In another scenario, the lower-level function registers the passed-in function as a handler that is to be called asynchronously by the lower-level at a later time in reaction to something. A callback can be used as a simpler alternative to polymorphism and generic programming, in that the exact behavior of a function can be dynamically determined by passing different (yet compatible) function pointers or handles to the lower-level function. This can be a very powerful technique for code reuse. 
Call-by-Reference	Call-by-Reference - Call-by-reference is an evaluation strategy in computer programming, in which a function is passed an implicit reference such as argument's address to its argument rather than the argument value itself. The called function then can directly access the argument through such reference. 
Call-by-Value	Call-by-Value - Call-by-value is the most common evaluation strategy in computer programming, used in languages as far-ranging as C and Scheme. When invoking functions in programming languages, if calling function pass the argument to called function by the copy of the argument's value, it's called Call-By-Value. Changes to the copy will never affect the original variable's value in the calling function. 
CAM: Computer-Aided Manufacturing	CAM: Computer-Aided Manufacturing - Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) refers to using software to generate the instruction codes for a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine in order for it to cut out a shape designed in a computer-aided design (CAD) system.

CAR: Computer-Assisted Reviewing	CAR: Computer-Assisted Reviewing - Computer-assisted reviewing (CAR) tools are pieces of software based on text comparison and analysis algorithms. They focus on differences between two documents, taking into account each document's typology through an intelligent analysis: differences do not have the same value depending on their type and/or the document field/subject. 
Careware	Careware - Careware, also known as charityware, is software distributed in a way that benefits a charity. Some careware is distributed free, and the author suggests that some payment be made to a nominated charity. Other careware includes a levy for charity on top of the distribution charge. 
CASE: Computer Aided Software Engineering	CASE: Computer Aided Software Engineering - Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) is the use of software tools to assist in the development and maintenance of software. Tools used to assist in this way are known as CASE Tools. CASE tools can help with one or more phases of the software life-cycle, including the project management, business and functional analysis, design, code generation, implementation, testing and maintenance of software. 
Casting Variable	Casting Variable - Casting Variable in computer programming simply means reassigning the type of a variable. When casting a variable from one type to another, all you are doing is telling the computer to use a different type to store the variable. For example, you declared a variable of type short. In most cases, that would mean that the largest positive value you could store would be 32,767. But somewhere in your program, you realize that you're going to have to do a calculation which could increase the value over this maximum. In this case, you need to perform casting variable. 
CATIA	CATIA - CATIA is the CAD/CAM/CAE commercial software suite developed by Dassault Systemes and marketed world-wide by IBM. It is commonly referred to as a 3D PLM software. All stages of product development are supported, from conceptualization, through design (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM) until analysis (CAE). It provides an open development architecure through interfaces which can be used to customize or develop applications. The API's are supported in Fortran and C for V4 and Visual Basic and C++ for V5. These API's are called CAA2 (or CAA V5). The CAA2 are COM based interfaces. These interfaces provide a seamless integration for products developed on the CATIA suite of software.

CD/DVD Authoring	CD/DVD Authoring - In computing, CD authoring or DVD authoring is the process of recording source material video, audio or other data onto a compact disc or DVD in a particular format.Authoring is commonly done in software on personal computers and workstations equipped with CD or DVD recorders. There are, however, stand-alone devices like personal video recorders which can also author and record discs. 
CDDL: Common Development and Distribution License	CDDL: Common Development and Distribution License - Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) is an open source and Free software license, produced by Sun Microsystems, based on the Mozilla Public License (MPL), version 1.1. The CDDL was submitted for approval to the Open Source Initiative on December 1, 2004 and approved as an open source license in mid-January 2005. The CDDL is one of the 9 preferred licenses listed by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). 
CeCILL: CEA CNRS INRIA Logiciel Libre	CeCILL: CEA CNRS INRIA Logiciel Libre - CEA CNRS INRIA Logiciel Libre (CeCILL) is a Free Software license adapted to both International and French legal matters, in the spirit of and retaining compatibility with the GNU General Public License. 
Cedega	Cedega - Cedega, formerly known as WineX, is TransGaming Technologies' proprietary fork of Wine, which is designed specifically for running games written for Microsoft Windows under Linux. As such, its primary focus is implementing the DirectX API. 
Celestia	Celestia - Celestia is an open source, 3D astronomy program for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux created by Chris Laurel. The program, based on the Hipparcos Catalogue, allows user to display objects ranging in scale from artificial satellites to entire galaxies in three dimensions using OpenGL. Unlike most planetarium software, the user is free to travel about the Universe. 
Censorware	Censorware - Censorware is a category of software that is used to do Internet content blocking or Internet filtering. In other words, Censorware limits the user's access to content on the Internet. Libraries and schools commonly use this type of filtering software to restrict its users from accessing pornography. Parents may also use censorware to restrict their children's access to the Internet. 
CFG: Control Flow Graph	CFG: Control Flow Graph - A control flow graph (CFG) is an abstract data structure used in compilers. It is an abstract representation of a procedure or program, maintained internally by a compiler. Each node in the graph represents a basic block, i.e. a straight-line piece of code without any jumps or jump targets; jump targets start a block, and jumps end a block. Directed edges are used to represent jumps in the control flow. There are, in most presentations, two specially designated blocks: the entry block, through which control enters into the flow graph, and the exit block, through which all control flow leaves. 
CFML: ColdFusion Markup Language	CFML: ColdFusion Markup Language - ColdFusion Markup Language(CFML) is a proprietary markup language developed by Allaire for use with ColdFusion. CFML is a tag-based Web scripting language supporting dynamic Web page creation and database access in a Web server environment. In the language, ColdFusion tags are embedded in HTML files. 
CGI: Common Gateway Interface	CGI: Common Gateway Interface - The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard for external gateway programs to interface with information servers such as HTTP servers. CGI scripts are commonly used on Web sites to achieve customised results. Generally, when the visitor performs some action, such as filling in a form or clicking on a link, the server executes a script using information input by the visitor. This allows the appearance or behaviour of the Web site to be customised for that visitor. 
cgi-bin	cgi-bin - cgi-bin is the usual name of the server directory in which Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs are held. 
CGI: Computer Generated Imagery	CGI: Computer Generated Imagery - Computer generated imagery (CGI), also known as Computer animation, is the application of the field of computer graphics (or more specifically, 3D computer graphics) to special effects. CGI is used in movies, television programs and commercials, and in printed media. Video games most often use real-time computer graphics (rarely referred to as CGI), but may also include pre-rendered cut scenes and intro movies that would be typical CGI applications. 
Character	Character - In computer and machine-based telecommunications terminology, a character is a unit of information that roughly corresponds to a grapheme or a grapheme-like unit or symbol, such as in an alphabet or syllabary in the written form of a natural language. An example of a character is a letter, numeral, or punctuation mark. This includes all the ASCII and extended ASCII characters, including the space and control characters. In character-based software, everything that appears on the screen, including graphics symbols, is considered to be a character. In graphics-based applications, the term character is generally reserved for letters, numbers, and punctuation. 
Character Code	Character Code - Character code is a computer code which represents a particular character or symbol with specific meaning. Most current operating systems use 8-bit character codes: some of which represent commands to the computer, while most of which represent the AlphaNumeric symbols of the main Western Languages. Other languages that use extended or alternate writing systems, such as Asian languages, use 16 bits and are so called Double Byte charater sets. 
Character Encoding	Character Encoding - A character encoding or character set (sometimes referred to as code page) consists of a code that pairs a sequence of characters from a given set with something else, such as a sequence of natural numbers, octets or electrical pulses, in order to facilitate the storage of text in computers and the transmission of text through telecommunication networks. Common examples include Morse code, which encodes letters of the Latin alphabet as series of long and short depressions of a telegraph key; and ASCII, which encodes letters, numerals, and other symbols, both as integers and as 7-bit binary versions of those integers, generally extended with an extra zero-bit to facilitate storage in 8-bit bytes (octets). 
Character Mapping	Character Mapping - Character mapping refers to the process of using a table used in an operating system or font to map the character codes to the glyphs used in a font. Most character encoding uses an 8-bit system allowing a maximum of 256 character codes. Extended or non-AlphaNumeric languages often use 16-bit or Double Byte encoding. Also, Character Maps or not necessarily cross platform compatible. For example, the Macintosh and Windows operating systems use differing character maps. However, Type 1 fonts do contain the glyphs necessary for both these mappings and so work in both Macintosh and Windows systems and others. 
Character Repertoire	Character Repertoire - Character repertoire is the set of all characters onto which a coded character set maps integers (code positions). 
Character Set	Character Set - Character set is a defined list of characters recognized by the computer hardware and software. Each character is represented by a number. The ASCII character set, for example, uses the numbers 0 through 127 to represent all English characters as well as special control characters. European ISO character sets are similar to ASCII, but they contain additional characters for European languages. 
Charmap: Character Map	Charmap: Character Map - Character Map (charmap.exe) is an applet included with Microsoft Windows operating systems which can be used to inspect the characters in any installed font, to check what keyboard input is used to select those characters, and to copy characters to the clipboard in lieu of typing them in. 
Checkpoint	Checkpoint - Checkpoint, in computer programming, is the point in the program source code where progress can be halted, while running, until conditions are suitable for progression to the next stage. 
Chinook Checkers Program	Chinook Checkers Program - Chinook is the first computer program that won the world checker champion title in the competition against humans. Chinook program's algorithm includes an opening book, a library of opening moves, from games played by grandmasters, deep search algorithm, good move evaluation function and the end-game database having all positions with eight or fewer pieces. The linear handcrafted evaluation function considered several features of the game board including piece count, kings count, trapped kings, turn, runaway checkers (unimpeded path to be kinged) and other minor factors. All of Chinook's 'knowledge' was programmed in by its creators vs the program learning strategies. 
CIF: Common Intermediate Format	CIF: Common Intermediate Format - Common Intermediate Format (CIF) is a video format used in videoconferencing systems that supports both NTSC and PAL signals. CIF is part of the ITU H.261 videoconferencing standard. It specifies a data rate of 30 frames per second (fps), with each frame containing 288 lines and 352 pixels per line. CIF is used to standardize the horizontal and vertical resolutions in pixels of YUV sequences in video signals. CIF has many variations for different resolutions and technologies. 
CIM: Common Information Model	CIM: Common Information Model - Common Information Model (CIM), a standard defined by organizations such as the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) and the IEC, provides a schema that defines how the managed elements in an IT environment are represented as a common set of objects and relationships between them. CIM allows multiple parties to exchange management information about these managed elements. CIM not only represents these managed elements and the management information, but also provides means to actively control and manage these elements. By using a common model of information, management software can be written once and work with many implementations of the common model without complex and costly conversion operations or loss of information. The managed elements represented in the CIM Schema include most of today's elements in an IT environment, for example Computer systems, Operating systems, Networks, Middleware, Services and Storage. 
Citadel Software	Citadel Software - Citadel is software for running a Bulletin Board System. The first Citadel came online in 1980 with a single 300 baud modem, and some versions of the software, supporting thousands of simultaneous users, are still in use today. Citadel development has always been collaborative with a strong push to keep the source code in the public domain. This makes Citadel one of the oldest surviving FOSS projects. 
CL: Common LISP	CL: Common LISP - Common Lisp (CL) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language, standardised by ANSI X3.226-1994. Developed to standardize the divergent variants of Lisp which predated it, it is not an implementation but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including commercial products and open source software. Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language, in contrast to Lisp variants such as Emacs Lisp and AutoLISP which are embedded extension languages in particular products. Unlike many earlier Lisps, Common Lisp (like Scheme) uses lexical variable scope. 
Class	Class - Class, in the context of object oriented computer language, is the prototype for an object in an object-oriented language; analogous to a derived type in a procedural language. A class may also be considered to be a set of objects which share a common structure and behaviour. The structure of a class is determined by the class variables which represent the state of an object of that class and the behaviour is given by a set of methods associated with the class. 
Class Library	Class Library - Class library is a term used in the object oriented language, whcih refers to collections of class definitions and implementations. Software companies like Microsoft created class libraries for reuses in programming. Class libraries and toolkits have the reputation of being open but too-much-assembly-required. A best of both worlds is to deliver a useful application composed from a toolkit where disassembly and reassembly for evolution is supported. 
Clean Install	Clean Install - Clean install refers to a way to install or upgrade an OS to a computer system. There are two ways to conduct a clean install. (1) upgrade of an operating system (OS) on a hard drive that already has an OS running off of it without carrying over any settings of the older OS, such as user preferences or information about the hardware and/or the software. (2) To install an OS on a hard drive that does not already have an OS installed on it or a newly formatted hard drive. 
ClearCase	ClearCase - ClearCase, developed by Rational software and now owned by IBM, provides lifecycle management and control of software development assets.

ClearQuest	ClearQuest - ClearQuest, developed by Rational software and now owned by IBM, enables better insight, predictability and control of the software development process. Through flexible workflow management and defect and change-tracking across the application lifecycle, Rational ClearQuest helps to automate and enforce development processes, manage issues throughout the project lifecycle, and facilitate communication between all stakeholders across the enterprise. 
Client	Client - In client/server computing, a client is a system that accesses a (remote) service on another computer by some kind of network. The term was first applied to devices that were not capable of running their own stand-alone programs, but could interact with remote computers via a network. These dumb terminals were clients of the time-sharing mainframe computer. 
Client-Side	Client-Side - In computer networking, the term client-side refers to operations that are performed by the client in a client-server relationship. Typically, a client is a software program, such as a web browser, that runs on a user's local computer or workstation and connects to a server as necessary. Operations may be performed on the client-side because they require access to information or functionality that is available on the client, but not on the server because the user needs to observe them or provide input, or because the server lacks the processing power to perform the operations in a timely manner for all of the clients it serves. 
CLISP	CLISP - CLISP, a Common Lisp implementation, is part of the GNU project, originally developed by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll. CLISP includes both an interpreter and a compiler (that compiles to bytecode), as well as a debugger, a socket interface, a high-level foreign language interface, strong internationalization support, and an object system (CLOS, MOP). It is written in C and Common Lisp. 
Closed Source	Closed Source - Closed source is a term invented as an antonym for open source and used to refer to any program whose licensing terms do not qualify as open source. Generally, it means that the customer will only get a binary version of the computer program they licensed and no copy of the program's source code, rendering modifications to the software practically impossible from the technical side. The source code in this development model is regarded as a trade secret of the company, so parties that may get source code access, such as colleges, have to sign non-disclosure agreements in advance. 
ClosedBSD	ClosedBSD - ClosedBSD is a derivative of FreeBSD aimed at providing firewall and Network Address Translation services. One of the advantages of ClosedBSD is that it can be run directly off a floppy disk or a CD-ROM, with no hard drive required. In spite of its small size, the software includes a fully-functional ncurses-based interface. 
Cloud computing	Cloud computing - Shared computing services provided on demand by computers accessed over the Internet.
cmd.exe	cmd.exe - Cmd.exe is the command line interpreter on OS/2 and on Windows NT-based systems (including Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003). It is the analog of command.com in MS-DOS and Windows 9x systems, or of the shells used on Unix systems. cmd.exe improves on command.com in several areas. It has a greater number of built-in commands, and the error reporting is better. In the OS/2 version of cmd.exe, errors are reported in whatever the current language of system is, their text being taken from the system message files. The help command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information. Both the OS/2 and the Windows NT versions of cmd.exe have more detailed error messages than that of command.com. 
CML: Chemical Markup Language	CML: Chemical Markup Language - Chemical Markup Language(CML) is an approach to managing molecular information using tools such as XML and Java. Chemical information is traditionally stored in many different files types which inhibit reuse of the documents. CML uses XML's portability to help CML developers and chemists design interoperable documents. There are a number of tools that can generate, process and view CML documents. Publishers can distribute chemistry within XML documents by using CML. 
CMM: Capabilities Maturity Model	CMM: Capabilities Maturity Model - Capability Maturity Model (CMM), developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University, is a collection of instructions an organization can follow with the purpose to gain better control over its software development process. The CMM ranks software development organizations according to a hierarchy of five process maturity levels. Each level ranks the development environment according to its capability of producing quality software. A set of standards is associated with each of the five levels. The standards for level one describe the most immature, or chaotic, process, and the standards for level five describe the most mature, or quality, process. 
Coco/R	Coco/R - Coco/R is a compiler generator (Compiler-compiler), which takes an attributed grammar of a source language and generates a scanner and a parser for this language. The scanner works as a deterministic finite automaton. The parser uses recursive descent. LL(1) conflicts can be resolved by a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic checks. Thus the class of accepted grammars is LL(k) for an arbitrary k. 
COCOMO: Constructive Cost Model	COCOMO: Constructive Cost Model - Constructive Cost Model(COCOMO) is a method of estimating the number of man-months it will take to develop a software product. There are three levels in the COCOMO: - 1) Basic COCOMO - is a static, single-valued model that computes software development effort (and cost) as a function of program size expressed in estimated lines of code. - 2) cost drivers that include subjective assessment of product, hardware, personnel and project attributes. - 3) Detailed COCOMO - incorporates all characteristics of the intermediate version with an assessment of the cost driver's impact on each step (analysis, design, etc.) of the software engineering process. 
Code	Code - Code, in Computer Programming refers to source code or machine code. Source code is any series of statements written in some human-readable computer programming language, while machine code refers to instructions for a computer processor in some machine language. The word code is often used to distinguish instructions from data. 
Code Co-op	Code Co-op - Code Co-op is the peer-to-peer version control system made by Reliable Software. Code Co-op uses peer-to-peer architecture to share projects among developers and to control changes to files. Instead of using a centralized database (the repository), it replicates its own database on each computer involved in the project. 
Code Generation	Code Generation - Code generation is the process by which a compiler converts a syntactically-correct program (source code) into a series of instructions that could be executed by a machine (Machine code). The input to the code generation stage typically consists of a parse tree, abstract syntax tree, or intermediate language code; the target machine may be a physical machine such as a microprocessor, or an abstract machine such as a virtual machine or an intermediate language, (human-readable code). 
Codec: Compression/Decompression	Codec: Compression/Decompression - In computing world, Codec refers to compression/decompression, which typically is an algorithm or specialized computer program that encodes or reduces the number of bytes consumed by large files and programs. Files encoded with a specific codec require the same codec for decoding. MPEG is a type of codec algorithms. 
Coded Character Set	Coded Character Set - Coded character set, also known as character encoding or character set, refers to the mapping from a set of integers to a set of characters. This mapping is generally 1:1. In ASCII code set, for example, the code position 65 in ASCII maps only to A, and it's the only position that maps to A. 
CodeView	CodeView - CodeView was a standalone debugger that originally shipped with Microsoft C/C++ 7.0 and earlier. It also shipped with Visual Basic for DOS. Upon the release of Microsoft Visual C++ 1.0, the functionality of CodeView was integrated into a single programming environment, known as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This integration is seen by many developers to be a more natural way of developing software since coding and debugging can be done without switching programs or context. 
CodeWarrior	CodeWarrior - CodeWarrior is an integrated development environment from Metrowerks for the Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, Linux and other systems such as embedded systems from Freescale Semiconductor. (Metrowerks is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Freescale.) Specialized versions for the Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Palm OS, and Symbian OS also exist, and there was even a version for BeOS. 
Coding	Coding - In computer hardware, coding is the process of converting information obtained on a subject or unit into coded values (typically numeric) for the purpose of data storage, management, and analysis. While in software, coding means implement a programing logic using a specific language such as C or C++. In cryptography, coding refers to the act of writing in code or cipher. 
COE: Common Operating Environment	COE: Common Operating Environment - Common operating environment (COE) specifies a common IT architecture within an organization and promotes interoperability and cross-platform capabilities among an organization's devices. In a COE, all workstations within an organization run the same software and use the same interfaces so that its devices are standardized and information presentation and platform interfaces are consistent throughout the organization. 
Cognitive Architecture	Cognitive Architecture - A cognitive architecture is a computational process that acts like a certain cognitive system, most often, like a person, or acts intelligent under some definition. The term architecture implies an approach that attempts to model not only behavior, but also structural properties of the modelled system. 
ColdFusion	ColdFusion - ColdFusion is a product that includes a server and a development toolset designed to integrate databases and Web pages. ColdFusion was created by Allaire Corporation of Cambridge, Mass. which merged with Macromedia and now part of Adobe Systems. With ColdFusion, a user could enter a zip code on a Web page, and the server would query a database for information on the nearest movie theaters and present the results in HTML form. Cold Fusion Web pages include tags written in Cold Fusion Markup Language (CFML) that simplify integration with databases and avoid the use of more complex languages like C++ to create translating programs. 
Collaborative Software	Collaborative Software - Collaborative software, also called social software, is a type of software that allows people to work together on the same documents and projects over local and remote networks. Collaborative software embraces the communications systems as well, including e-mail, videoconferencing, instant messaging and chat. Lotus Notes is an example of collaborative software. 
COM: Component Object Model	COM: Component Object Model - Component Object Model (COM) is a Microsoft platform for software componentry introduced in 1993, largely to replace the interprocess communication mechanism DDE used by the initial release of OLE. It is used to enable interprocess communication and dynamic object creation in any programming language that supports the technology. The term COM is often used in the software development world as an umbrella term that encompasses the OLE, OLE Automation, ActiveX, COM+ and DCOM technologies. COM provides a language-neutral way of implementing objects such that they can be used in environments different from the one they were created in, even across machine boundaries. For well-authored components, COM allows reuse of objects with no knowledge of their internal implementation because it forces component implementers to provide well-defined interfaces that are separate from the implementation. 
Command	Command - Command, in computing, refers to an instruction to a computer or device to perform a specific task. Every program that interacts with people responds to a specific set of commands. The set of commands and the syntax for entering them is called the user interface. Commonly a command is a directive to some kind of command line interface, such as a command interpreter. Commands come in different forms such as: 1) special words (keywords) that a program understands 2) function keys 3) choices in a menu 4) buttons or other graphical objects on your screen. 
Command Interpreter	Command Interpreter - Command interpreter is a program which reads textual commands from the user or from a file and executes them. Some commands may be executed directly within the interpreter itself (e.g. setting variables or control constructs), others may cause it to load and execute other files. Unix's command interpreters are known as shells. 
Command.com	Command.com - COMMAND.COM is the name for the default operating system shell (or command line interpreter) for DOS and 16/32bits versions of Windows (95/98/98 SE/Me). It also has an additional role, as the first program run after boot, hence being responsible for setting up the system by running the AUTOEXEC.BAT configuration file, and being the ancestor of all processes. COMMAND.COM has two distinct modes of work. First is the interactive mode, in which the user types commands which are then executed immediately. The second is the batch mode, which executes a predefined sequence of commands stored as a text file with the extension .BAT. Its function as the default command interpreter is analogous to that of the Unix shells, although COMMAND.COM's functionality is considerably more limited than that of its Unix counterparts. cmd.exe is COMMAND.COM's successor on Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 and OS/2. COMMAND.COM is also available on those systems to provide compatibility when running DOS applications. 
Commercial Software	Commercial Software - Commercial software is a computer software sold for commercial purposes or that serves commercial purposes. The most famous examples of commercial software are the products offered on the IBM PC and clones in the 1980s and 90s, including famous programs like Lotus 123, Word Perfect and the various parts that make up Microsoft Office. Commercial software may be re-packaged in boxes and sold in retail stores or directly from vendors. Downloadable software over the Internet for commercial purpose is becoming popular. 
Common Core Services	Common Core Services - Common core services are services that the operating system has to take care of, these are usually administrated by the Kernel of an operating system. These may include: - Memory management - Internet functionality - Network Security features - Library manager - loader - Execute applications - Disk access - User interface - Application programming interface 
Communications Software	Communications Software - Communications software refers to the type of software that is used for network communication purpose. For example, the software used to send and receive data over telephone lines through modems. 
Compatible	Compatible - Compatible, in computer industry, refers to the ability of one device or program to work with another device or program. For example, a printer and a computer are said to be compatible if they can be connected to each other. An IBM compatible PC, on the other hand, is a computer that can run the same software as an IBM PC. 
Compiler	Compiler - Compiler is a type of computer program that translates source code into object code. A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: lexing, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis, code optimizations, and code generation. 
Compiler Bug	Compiler Bug - A compiler bug is a type of computer bug. Compiler bug may cause translating the source program incorrectly, so that when the program runs it produces the wrong answer or some error message that does not really relate to the original program. Some compilers also attempt to optimize the source code during translation, so that it will run faster, or use less memory, or both. This optimization is often the most complicated part of a compiler, and hence is likely to have the most bugs. 
Compiler Directive	Compiler Directive - Compiler directive is data embedded in source code by programmers to tell compilers some intention about compilation. A compiler directive often tells the compiler how to compile; other source code tells the compiler what to be compiled. 
Compiler Optimization	Compiler Optimization - Compiler optimization is the process of using some optimization techniques that have been programmed into a compiler, to improve the performance or reach other objectives of the source code. These techniques are automatically applied by the compiler whenever they are appropriate. Because programmers no longer need to manually apply these techniques, programmers are free to write source code in a straightforward manner, expressing their intentions clearly. Then the compiler can choose the most efficient way to handle the implementation details. 
Compiler-Compiler	Compiler-Compiler - A compiler-compiler, also known as a parser generator, is a utility for generating the source code of a parser, interpreter or compiler from an annotated language description in the form of a grammar (usually in BNF) plus code that is associated with each of the rules of the grammar that should be executed when these rules are applied by the parser. These pieces of code are sometimes referred to as semantic action routines since they define the semantics of the syntactic structure that is analysed by the parser. 
Componetware: Component Software	Componetware: Component Software - Component software (componentware) is a type of software designed to work as a component of a larger application. The goal of component software is to standardize the interfaces between software components so that all components can work together seamlessly. Therefore, ideally, it is possible to mix software components from different manufacturers in a single system. Two standards -- OLE and OpenDoc -- are designed to help programmers develop components that can work together. 
Computational Linguistics	Computational Linguistics - Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field dealing with the statistical and logical modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. This modeling is not limited to any particular field of linguistics. Computational linguistics was formerly usually done by computer scientists who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language. Recent research has shown that language is much more complex than previously thought, so computational linguistics work teams are now sometimes interdisciplinary. Computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence, cognitive psychologists and logicians, amongst others. 
Computational Science	Computational Science - Computational science, also known as scientific computing, is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and numerical solution techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific and engineering problems. In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation to problems in various scientific disciplines such as Physics. Computational science and computer science are very different fields. 
Computer Animation	Computer Animation - Computer animation, also known as Computer generated imagery (CGI) is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, sometimes the target is another medium, such as film. 
Computer Game	Computer Game - A computer game is a computer-controlled game with or without video technologies involved. In common usage, a computer game or a PC game refers to a game that is played on a personal computer. There always must also be some sort of input device, usually in the form of button/joystick combinations (on arcade games), a keyboard & mouse/trackball combination (computer games), or a controller (console games), or a combination of any of the above. Also, more esoteric devices have been used for input (see also Game controller). Usually there are rules and goals, but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of the virtual universe. 
Computer Graphics	Computer Graphics - Computer graphics (CG) is the field of visual computing, where one utilizes computers both to generate visual images synthetically and to integrate or alter visual and spatial information sampled from the real world. Computer graphics field can be divided into several areas: real-time 3D rendering (often used in video games), computer animation, video capture and video creation rendering, special effects editing (often used for movies and television), image editing, and modeling (often used for engineering and medical purposes). Development in computer graphics was first fueled by academic interests and government sponsorship. However, as real-world applications of computer graphics in broadcast television and movies proved a viable alternative to more traditional special effects and animation techniques, commercial parties have increasingly funded advances in the field. 
Computer Science	Computer Science - Computer science, or computing science, is an academic field that studys the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems. Computer science has many sub-fields; some emphasize the computation of specific results (such as computer graphics), while others (such as computational complexity theory) relate to properties of computational problems. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, programming language theory studies approache to describing computations, while computer programming applies specific programming languages to solve specific computational problems. 
ConceptBase	ConceptBase - ConceptBase is a deductive and object-oriented database management system based on Datalog rather than SQL. It stores all factual information in a single flat data structure called P-facts. On top of that deductive rules, integrity constraints, and queries are defined to capture the semantics of the application domain. The main application domain of ConceptBase is conceptual modeling, model management, and meta modeling. 
Config Files: Configuration Files	Config Files: Configuration Files - In computing, configuration files (config files) are used to configure the initial settings for some computer programs. They are used for user applications, server processes and operating system settings. The files are often written in ASCII (rarely UTF-8) and line-oriented, with lines terminated by a newline or carriage return/line feed pair, depending on the operating system. They may be considered a simple database. 
CONFIG.SYS	CONFIG.SYS - CONFIG.SYS is the primary configuration file for the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. It is a special file that contains setup or configuration instructions for the computer system. The commands in this file configure DOS for use with devices and applications in the system. The commands also set up the memory managers in the system. After processing the CONFIG.SYS file, DOS proceeds to load and execute the command shell specified in the shell= line of CONFIG.SYS, or COMMAND.COM if there is no such line. The command shell in turn is responsible for processing the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 
Configuration	Configuration - In communications or computer systems, configuration is the way a system is set up, or the assortment of components that make up the system. Configuration can refer to either hardware or software, or the combination of both. Often, configuration pertains to the choice of hardware, software, firmware, and documentation. The configuration affects system function and performance. 
Configuration Management	Configuration Management - In software development, configuration management is a system for keeping track of large software projects. Configuration management system include functions such as version control and automatically documents all components used to build executable programs. It is able to recreate each build as well as to recreate earlier environments in order to maintain previous versions of a product. It may also be used to prevent unauthorized access to files or to alert the appropriate users when a file has been altered. 
Constant Folding	Constant Folding - Constant folding is one of the compiler optimization techniques used by many modern compilers. Constant folding is the process of simplifying constant expressions at compile time. Terms in constant expressions are typically simple literals, such as the integer 2, but can also be variables whose values are never modified, or variables explicitly marked as constant. 
Constant Propagation	Constant Propagation - Constant propagation is one of the compiler optimization techniques used by many modern compilers. Constant propagation is the process of substituting the values of known constants in expressions at compile time. Such constants include those defined above, as well as intrinsic functions applied to constant values. 
Constraint Logic Programming	Constraint Logic Programming - Constraint logic programming is a form of constraint programming, in which logic programming is extended to include concepts from constraint satisfaction. A constraint logic program is a logic program that contains constraints in the body of clauses. An example of a clause including a constraint is A(X,Y) ;:- X+Y>0, B(X), C(Y). In this clause, X+Y>0 is a constraint; A(X,Y), B(X), and C(Y) are literals like in regular logic programming. Intuitively, this clause tells one condition under which the statement A(X,Y) holds: this is the case if X+Y is greater than zero and both B(X) and C(Y) are true. 
Constraint Programming	Constraint Programming - Constraint programming is a programming paradigm where relations between variables can be stated in the form of constraints. Constraints differ from the common primitives of other programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute but rather the properties of a solution to be found. The constraints used in constraint programming are of various kinds: those used in constraint satisfaction problems, those solved by the simplex algorithm, and others. Constraints are usually embedded within a programming language or provided via separate software libraries. 
Constraint Satisfaction	Constraint Satisfaction - In artificial intelligence and operations research, constraint satisfaction is the process finding a solution to a set of constraints. Such constraints express allowed values for variables, and a solution is therefore an evaluation of these variable that satisfies all constraints. 
Content Management System	Content Management System - A content management system is a computer software system for organizing and facilitating collaborative creation of documents and other content. For example, a content management system may be a web application used for managing websites and web content. They can also be used for storage and single sourcing of documentation for a firm including but not limited to operators' manuals, technical manuals, sales guides, etc. 
Control Panel	Control Panel - Control panel refers to the front end of a system which can set the configuration of the system. For example, in a PC or a Macintosh, control panel is part of the operating system that has the ability to control an aspect of system configuration, such as the display, software add/remove, language and network properties. 
Cooperative Multitasking	Cooperative Multitasking - Cooperative multitasking, also known as non-preemptive multitasking, is a form of multitasking where it is the responsibility of the currently running task to give up the processor to allow other tasks to run. This contrasts with pre-emptive multitasking where the task scheduler periodically suspends the running task and restarts another. Cooperative multitasking has the advantage of making the operating system design much simpler, but it also makes it less stable because a poorly designed application may not cooperate well, and this often causes system freezes. 
Copy Propagation	Copy Propagation - Copy propagation, a optimization technique in the program compiler, is the process of replacing the occurrences of targets of direct assignments with their values. A direct assignment is an instruction of the form x = y, which simply assigns the value of y to x. Copy propagation is a useful clean up optimization frequently used after other optimizations have already been run. 
Copycat	Copycat - Copycat refers to the tendency of humans to duplicate the behavior of others. Copycat is also the name of a model of analogy making and human cognition based on the concept of the parallel terraced scan, developed by Douglas Hofstadter, Melanie Mitchell, and others. 
Copyleft	Copyleft - In a non-legal sense, copyleft, a play on the word copyright, is the opposite of copyright. Copyleft refers to the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on the distribution of copies and modified versions of a work for others and require the same freedoms be preserved in modified versions. A widely used copyleft license is the GNU General Public License (GPL). Many fans of copyleft media believe that copyleft is a cross between copyright and public domain. 
Copyright	Copyright - Copyright is a set of exclusive rights regulating the use of a particular expression of an idea or information, including but not limited to art designs, computer software, books, documents etc. At its most general, it is literally the right to copy an original creation. In most cases, these rights are of limited duration. The symbol for copyright is, and in some jurisdictions may alternately be written (c). 
Copyright Infringement	Copyright Infringement - The copyright infringement of software refers to several practices when done without the permission of the copyright holder: - 1. Creating a copy and selling it. This is the act most people refer to as software piracy. It is illigel in most countries. - 2. Creating a copy and giving it to someone else. This constitutes copyright infringement in most jurisdictions. It is not infringing under specific circumstances such as fair use and fair dealing. - 3. Creating a copy to serve as a backup. This is seen as a fundamental right of the software-buyer in some countries. It can be infringement, depending on the laws and the case law interpretations of those laws. - 4. Renting the original software. Software licenses often try to restrict the usual right of a purchaser of a copyrighted work to let others borrow the work. In some jurisdictions the validity of such restrictions are disputed. - 5. Reselling the original software. Licenses often say that the buyer does not buy the software but instead pays for the right to use the software. Therefore, the buyer can not resell the software without specific permission of the software vendor. 
CORC: CORnell Compiler	CORC: CORnell Compiler - CORnell Compiler(CORC) was a simple computer language developed at Cornell University in 1962 to serve students for math problems. Its developers, industrial engineering professors Richard Conway and William Maxwell and mathematics professor Robert J. Walker, sought to create a diagnostic compiler in PL/I which could both expose math and engineering students to computing and remove the burden of mechanical problem-solving from their professors. 
CORE: Challenge of Reverse Engineering	CORE: Challenge of Reverse Engineering - Challenge of Reverse Engineering (CORE) is a software cracking group for the IBM PC which was founded in June of 1997 by a team of members from Ontario, Canada. Within four years the group made more than 10,000 releases (cracks, key generators and the like). These days the group is growing larger and there are already subgroups -- COREPDA (which is working with software for PocketPC, PDA etc.) and COREUtile. The Group CORE is today active and still working. 
CosmicOS	CosmicOS - CosmicOS is a self-contained message designed to be understood primarily by treating it as a computer program and executing it. Self-contained messages are of interest for CETI research, but there is much difference of opinion over the most appropriate encoding and broadcast medium to use. CosmicOS is released in modular form, so that the basic message can be adapted to a particular concrete instantiation. 
Course Management System	Course Management System - A course management system is a computer program that facilitates computerised learning or e-learning, especially by helping teachers and learners with course administration. Such e-learning system is also called Learning Management Systems (LMS), Virtual Learning Environments (VLE), education via computer-mediated communication (CMC) or Online Education. 
Crack Intro	Crack Intro - A crack intro, also known as a cracktro, loader, or just intro, is a small introduction sequence added to cracked software, designed to inform the user which cracking crew or individual cracker was responsible for removing the software's copy prevention and distributing the crack. 
Critical Section	Critical Section - In computer programming a critical section is a piece of code or a set of instructions that can only be executed by one process or thread at a time. If the instructions are interrupted, a race condition might occur. It will usually terminate in fixed time, and a process will only have to wait a fixed time to enter it. Some synchronisation mechanism is required at the entry and exit of the critical section to ensure exclusive use. 
CRM: Customer Relationship Management	CRM: Customer Relationship Management - Customer Relationship Management(CRM) is an information system that is used to plan, schedule and control the presales and postsales activities in an organization to manage customer relationships. CRM embraces all aspects of dealing with prospects and customers, including the call center, sales force, marketing, technical support and field service. There are three parts of application architecture of CRM: - Operational - automation to the basic business processes (marketing, sales, service) - Collaborative - ensures the contact with customers (phone, email, fax, web, sms, post, in person) 
Cron	Cron - Cron is a Unix application that runs jobs for users and administrators at scheduled times of the day. 
Cross Compiler	Cross Compiler - A cross compiler is a compiler capable of creating executable code for another platform than the one on which the cross compiler is run. Such a tool is handy when you want to compile code for a platform that you don't have access to, or because it is inconvenient or impossible to compile on that platform (as is the case with embedded systems.) 
Crowd Simulation	Crowd Simulation - Crowd simulation is the process of simulating the movement of a large number of objects or characters, now often appearing in 3D computer graphics for film. The need for crowd simulation arises when a scene calls for more characters than can be practically animated using conventional systems, such as skeletons/bones. 
CSCI: Computer Software Configuration Item	CSCI: Computer Software Configuration Item - Computer Software Configuration Item(CSCI) is a group of software treated as a single entity by a configuration management (CM) system. CSCI is for configuration control at the system architectural design, by contractual specification, or as development products. CSCI entities include software products to be developed or used under contract, and certain elements required from the software development environment. 
CSE: Common Subexpression Elimination	CSE: Common Subexpression Elimination - Common subexpression elimination (CSE), a term in compiler theory, is the practice of finding repeated redundant expression evaluations, and replacing them with a single computation assigned to a temporary variable. Although it can be done manually, the term usually refers to a compiler optimization. 
CSV: Comma Separated Values	CSV: Comma Separated Values - Comma Separated Values (CSV) is a data type that is commonly used no-frills text file format for import from and export to spreadsheets and SQL databases. 
CUA: Common User Access	CUA: Common User Access - Common User Access (CUA) is a set of guidelines for the user interface to personal computer operating systems and computer programs, developed by IBM starting in 1987 as part of their Systems Application Architecture. Used originally in the OS/2 and Microsoft Windows operating systems, parts of the CUA standard are now implemented in programs for other operating systems, including variants of Unix. Java AWT and Swing use it as well. The CUA contains standards for the operation of dialog boxes, menus and keyboard shortcuts. For example, in programs written to the CUA standard, help is always summoned by pressing the F1 function key. New programs should be easier to use because users will not have to learn new commands to perform standard tasks. 
Cubase	Cubase - Cubase is a MIDI, music sequencer and digital audio editing computer application (commonly known as a DAW - Digital Audio Workstation) created by the German firm Steinberg in 1989. Cubase started as a MIDI recording and editing tool. Later, features for recording raw audio were introduced. Cubase was originally written for the Atari ST, and has since been ported to Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. 
Custom Software	Custom Software - Custom software, also called bespoke software, is software that was developed with a specific organization and its requirements in mind. Custom software is necessary when mass market software does not satisfy the functionalities required. 
Customized Toolbar	Customized Toolbar - Customized toolbar is a toolbar that can be custom configured (modified) by the user. For example, buttons in the toolbar can be added and deleted as required. 
CVS: Concurrent Versions System	CVS: Concurrent Versions System - The Concurrent Versions System (CVS), also known as the Concurrent Versioning System, implements a version control system: it keeps track of all work and all changes in a set of files, typically the implementation of a software project, and allows several (potentially widely separated) developers to collaborate. CVS has become popular in the free software and open-source worlds. CVS is released under the GNU General Public License. 
Cwiab: Church Website in a Box	Cwiab: Church Website in a Box - Church Website in a Box (CWIAB) is a free, open source content management system created from Postnuke, released under the GNU General Public License. The CWIAB project was started because Postnuke was very well suited for use by churches, but quite a bit of effort was still required collecting various PostNuke modules and installing them. Church Website in a Box can be installed in minutes and provides adequate functionality for most churches 'out of the box.' CWIAB is not a fork, but a collection of PostNuke and relevant modules. 
Cyclomatic Complexity	Cyclomatic Complexity - Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric (measurement) concept in computational complexity theory. It was developed by Thomas McCabe and is used to generally measure the complexity of a program. It directly measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. 
Cygwin	Cygwin - Cygwin is a collection of free software tools originally developed by Cygnus Solutions to allow various versions of Microsoft Windows to act somewhat like a UNIX system. It aims mainly at porting software that runs on POSIX systems (such as Linux systems, BSD systems, and UNIX systems) to run on Windows with little more than a recompilation. Cygwin is currently maintained by employees of Red Hat and others.
Daemon	Daemon - In Unix and other computer multitasking operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs in the background, rather than under the direct control of a user; they are usually instantiated as processes. The Daemon program, often started at the time the system boots and runs continuously without intervention from any of the users on the system, forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate. Typically daemons have names that end with the letter d; for example, syslogd is the daemon which handles the system log. Windows OS refers to daemons as System Agents and services. 
DAM: Digital Asset Management	DAM: Digital Asset Management - Digital asset management (DAM) refers to the practice and domain of organizing digital files, like images, documents, videos and presentations. The term asset is used to indicate that such files have some sort of intrinsic value that makes it worthwhile to manage them. DAM is related to and can be considered a superset of content management. For more information see also digital asset management systems and content management systems. To manage digital assets effectively, assets must be made available to the people who need them to efficiently contribute to the growth of the culture using them. 
DARCS: David's Advanced Revision Control System	DARCS: David's Advanced Revision Control System - David's Advanced Revision Control System (Darcs) is a distributed software revision control system designed by David Roundy to replace the centralized Concurrent Versions System (CVS). In the Darcs Each copy of the source tree acts as a full repository, allowing several different versions to be maintained in different locations. Patches are global to the repository and are subject under certain conditions to reordering, as governed by the project's theory of patches 
Data	Data - Data, in information industry, refers to distinct pieces of information, usually formatted in a special way. All information system is divided into two general categories: data and programs. Data can exist in a variety of forms - as numbers or text on pieces of paper, as bits and bytes stored in electronic memory, or as facts stored in a person's mind. Programs refer to the collections of instructions for manipulating data, which may be software programs for compute processing, or a set of instructions for manual data operation. 
Data Architect	Data Architect - A data architect is a person responsible for making sure an organization's strategic goals are optimized through the use of enterprise data standards. Data architect's job frequently includes the set up and maintain a metadata registry and allows domain-specific stakeholders to maintain their own data elements. 
Data Architecture	Data Architecture - Data architecture describes how data is processed, stored, and utilized in a given system. It provides criteria for data processing operations that make it possible to design data flows and also control the flow of data in the system. Data architecture also includes topics such as metadata management, business semantics, data modeling and metadata workflow management. 
Data Cleansing	Data Cleansing - Data cleansing, also called as data scrubbing, is the process of detecting and removing and/or correcting a database to increase data accuracy, reduce redundancy and enhance consistency of different sets of data that have been merged from separate databases. Sophisticated software applications are available to clean a database data using algorithms, rules and look-up tables, a task that was once done manually and therefore still subject to human error. 
Data Conversion	Data Conversion - Data conversion is the conversion of one form of computer data to another--the changing of bits from being in one format to a different one, usually for the purpose of application interoperability or of capability of using new features. At the simplest level, data conversion can be exemplified by conversion of a text file from one character encoding to another. More complex conversions are those of office file formats, and conversions of image and audio file formats are an endeavor that is beyond the ken of ordinary computer users. 
Data Element	Data Element - Data element, as a term used in metadata, is an atomic unit of data that has the following characters: 1) An identification such as a data element name; 2) A clear data element definition; 3) One or more representation terms; 4) Optional enumerated values Code (metadata); 5) A list of synonyms to data elements in other metadata registries Synonym ring. Data elements usage can be discovered by inspection of software applications or application data files through a process of manual or automated Application Discovery and Understanding. Once data elements are discovered, they can be registered in a metadata registry. 
Data element definition	Data element definition - In metadata, a data element definition is a human readable phrase or sentence associated with a data element within a data dictionary that describes the meaning or semantics of a data element. Data element definitions are critical for external users of any data system. Good definitions can dramatically ease the process of mapping one set of data into another data set of data. This is a core feature of distributed computing and intelligent agent development. 
Data Mapping	Data Mapping - Data mapping is the process of creating data element mappings between two distinct data models. Data mapping is the first step in creating a data transformation between a data source and a destination. For example, a company that would like to transmit and receive purchases and invoices with other companies might use data mapping to create data maps from a company's data to standardized ANSI ASC X12 messages for items such as purchase orders and invoices. 
Data Migration	Data Migration - Data migration refers to the translation of data between storage types, formats, or computer systems. Data migration is necessary when an organization decides to use a new computing systems or database management system that is incompatible with the current system. Data migration is usually performed programatically to achieve an automated migration, freeing up human resources from tedious tasks. It is required when organizations or individuals change computer systems or upgrade to new systems. 
Data Modeling	Data Modeling - Data modeling is the process of structuring and organizing data. It defines a structure for data that is typically implemented in a database management system and that enables (and limits) to enter data in that structure. Data modeling is often the first step in database design and object-oriented programming as the designers first create a conceptual model of how data items relate to each other. Data modeling involves a progression from conceptual model to logical model to physical schema. 
Data Processing	Data Processing - Data processing is a computer process that converts data into required information. The processing is usually assumed to be automated and running on a computer. There are many data processing applications, such as accounting programs that convert raw financial data into meaninful reports for various purpose. Another example is customer relationship management systems (CRM) and employee relationship data systems. 
Data Scrubbing	Data Scrubbing - Data scubbing, also called as data cleaning, is the process of detecting and removing and/or correcting a database to increase data accuracy, reduce redundancy and enhance consistency of different sets of data that have been merged from separate databases. Sophisticated software applications are available to clean a database data using algorithms, rules and look-up tables, a task that was once done manually and therefore still subject to human error. 
Data Structure	Data Structure - Data structure is the pattern to store data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Often a carefully chosen data structure will allow a more efficient algorithm to be used. The choice of the data structure often begins from the choice of an abstract data structure. A well-designed data structure allows a variety of critical operations to be performed, using as few resources, both execution time and memory space, as possible. Data structures are implemented using the data types, references and operations on them provided by a programming language. 
Data Transformation	Data Transformation - Data transformation converts data from a source data format into destination data. Data transformation can be divided into two steps: 1) data mapping maps data elements from the source to the destination and captures any transformation that must occur; 2) code generation that creates the actual transformation program. 
Database Administration	Database Administration - Database administration refers to duties, typically performed by a DBA in an organization, such as disaster recovery (backups and testing of backups), performance analysis and tuning, and some database design or assistance thereof. 
Database Model	Database Model - A database model is a theory or algorithm describing how a database is structured and used. Several such models have been suggested, for example, Hierarchical model, Network model, Relational model, Object-Relational model, Object model, Associative, Concept-oriented, Entity-Attribute-Value, Multi-dimensional model, Semi-structured, and Star schema. 
Database Normalization	Database Normalization - Databases normalization is a process that eliminates redundancy, organizes data efficiently, reduces the potential for anomalies during data operations and improves data consistency. The formal classifications used for quantifying how normalized a relational database is are called normal forms. A non-normalized database is vulnerable to data anomalies because it stores data redundantly. If data is stored in two locations, but later is updated in only one of the locations, then the data is inconsistent; this is referred to as an update anomaly. A normalized database stores non-primary key data in only one location. 
Database Object	Database Object - Database Object is a piece of information or record that is stored in a database. 
Database Query Language	Database Query Language - Database query language is a kind of programming language to retrieve information from a database. The person formulating the query is expected to understand the relevant rules for formulating the query, and to program the query according to the requirements. Examples of the database query language are the CODASYL database language, network databases, relational algebra, relational calculus, Datalog, SQL3, QUEL, XPointer, XPath and OQL. 
Database Server	Database Server - A database server is a computer program that provides database services to other computer programs or computers, as defined by the client-server model. The term may also refer to a computer dedicated to running such a program. Database management systems frequently provide database server functionality, and some DBMS's (e.g., MySQL) rely exclusively on the client-server model for database access. 
Datalog	Datalog - Datalog is a query and rule language for deductive databases that syntactically is a subset of Prolog. Query evaluation with Datalog is sound and complete and can be done efficiently even for large databases. Query evaluation is usually done using bottom up strategies. For restricted forms of datalog that don't allow any function symbols, safety of query evaluation is guaranteed. 
Dating Software	Dating Software - Dating software refers to software that powers a dating website. This software runs on the server (computer) that hosts the dating website. 
DB/DC: Database/Data Communications	DB/DC: Database/Data Communications - Database/Data Communications (DB/DC) refers to the software system that has both database and communications capabilities. 
DB: Database	DB: Database - Database(DB) is a collection of organized information and data. In computer industry, database is an electronic filing system. Various techniques are used to model data structure. Most database systems are built around one particular data model, although it is increasingly common for products to offer support for more than one model. Traditional databases are organized by fields, records, and files. A field is a single piece of information; a record is one complete set of fields; and a file is a collection of records. 
DB2: DataBase 2	DB2: DataBase 2 - DB2, abbreviated from DataBase 2, is a relational database system developed by IBM Corporation, originally for use on large mainframe computer systems. It has since been ported to a variety of platforms including SunOS, Solaris, Linux, Windows 95/98/NT/2000 and HP-UX. DB2 can be administered from either the command-line or a GUI. DB2 has APIs for .NET CLI, Java, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby on Rails, C++, C, REXX, PL/I, COBOL, RPG, FORTRAN, and many other programming languages. DB2 also supports integration into the Eclipse and Visual Studio .NET integrated development environments. 
DBA: Database Administrator	DBA: Database Administrator - A database administrator (DBA) is a person who is responsible for the environmental aspects of a database. The duties of a database administrator varies depending on job description, corporate and Information Technology (IT) policies and the technical features and capabilities of the database management systems (DBMSs) being administered. They nearly always include disaster recovery (backups and testing of backups), performance analysis and tuning, and some database design or assistance thereof. 
DBase	DBase - DBase is a commercial relational database management system intruduced first by Ashton-Tate corporation in the early 1980s and now belongs to the dBase Corporation. DBASE was never able to make transition successfully to Microsoft Windows and was eventually displaced by newer products like Paradox, Clipper, FoxPro, and Microsoft Access. 
DBCS: Double-Byte Character Set	DBCS: Double-Byte Character Set - Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS) is a type of character encoding scheme which uses 16-bits (two-bytes) rather than 8-bits (one-bytes) characters. Using double-byte characters expands the possible number of combinations of 1s and 0s from 256 (as in ASCII) to 65,536 (or 256 x 256). Double-byte character sets are needed for such languages as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. DBCS has different flavors, for example, double byte for ALL characters (including control character), or double byte only for image characters. 
DBI: DataBase Interface for Perl	DBI: DataBase Interface for Perl - The DBI (DataBase Interface) is the standard database interface module for Perl programming language. It defines a set of methods, variables and conventions that provide a consistent database interface independent of the actual database being used. The DBI and DBD Perl packages allow Perl programmers to view the many database environments that are on the market in a uniform way. 
DBMS: Database Management Ssystem	DBMS: Database Management Ssystem - Database management system (DBMS) is a system or software designed to manage a database, and run operations on the data requested by numerous clients. Typical examples of DBMS use include accounting, human resources and customer support systems. DBMS enables user to store, modify, and extract information from a database. There are many different types of DBMSs, ranging from small systems that run on personal computers to huge systems that run on mainframes. 
Dbx Debugger	Dbx Debugger - Dbx is a popular, UNIX-based source-level debugger found primarily on Solaris, AIX, IRIX, and BSD UNIX systems. It provides symbolic debugging for programs written in C, C++, Pascal, and Fortran.dbx is also available on IBM z/OS systems, in the UNIX System Services component. dbx for z/OS can debug programs written in C and C++. It can also perform machine level debugging. As of z/OS V1R5, dbx is able to debug programs using the DWARF debug format. z/OS V1R6 added support for debugging 64-bit programs. 
DCL: Data Control Language	DCL: Data Control Language - Data Control Language (DCL) is a computer language for controlling access to data in a database. Examples of DCL commands are GRANT and REVOKE. 
DCOM: Distributed Component Object Model	DCOM: Distributed Component Object Model - Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), developed by Microsoft and previously called Network OLE, enables software components to communicate directly over a network. DCOM is designed for use across multiple network transports, including such Internet protocols as HTTP. 
DDD: Data Display Debugger	DDD: Data Display Debugger - Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a popular graphical user interface for command-line debuggers such as GDB, DBX, JDB, WDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, and the Python debugger.DDD is licensed under the GNU GPL and is open source. 
DDL: Data Definition Language	DDL: Data Definition Language - Data Definition Language(DDL) is a computer language for defining data. XML Schema is an example of a pure DDL (although only relevant in the context of XML). A subset of SQL's instructions forms another DDL. 
DDMS: Distributed Database Management System	DDMS: Distributed Database Management System - Distributed database management system (DDMS) is a software system that permits the management of the distributed database and makes the distribution transparent to the users. Distributed database is a collection of multiple, logically interrelated databases distributed over a computer network. Sometimes distributed database system is used to refer jointly to the distributed database and the distributed Database Management System(DBMS). Distributed database management systems can be architected as client-server systems or peer-to-peer ones. In the former, one or more servers manage the database and handle user queries that are passed on by the clients. The clients usually have limited database functionality and normally pass the SQL queries over to the servers for processing. In peer-to-peer systems, each site has equal functionality for processing. 
DDT: Dynamic Debugging Technique	DDT: Dynamic Debugging Technique - Dynamic Debugging Technique (DDT) was the name of several debugger programs originally developed for DEC hardware, originally known as DEC Debugging Tape because it was distributed on paper tape. The first version of DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1 computer in 1961, but newer versions on newer platforms continued to use the same name. 
Dead Code	Dead Code - In computer programming, dead code, also known as unreachable code, typically consists of blocks of programming instructions or entire routines that will never be accessed because all calls to them have been removed, or code that cannot be reached for some reason. Dead code is undesirable for a number of reasons, but primarily because it suggests that there is a fault in the software. Detecting dead code is a form of static analysis and involves performing control flow analysis to find any code that will never be executed regardless of the values of variables and other conditions at runtime. 
Dead code Elimination	Dead code Elimination - Dead code elimination is a compiler optimization technique used to reduce program size by removing code which can never be executed (known as dead or unreachable code). 
Debug Monitor	Debug Monitor - Debug monitor is a piece of software that has been designed specifically for use as a debugging tool for processors and chips. The debug monitor provides a set of primitive commands to view and modify memory locations and registers, create and remove breakpoints, and execute your program. A remote debugger with knowledge of the command format communicates with the debug monitor and combines these primitives to fulfill higher-level requests like program download and single-step. 
Debugger	Debugger - Debugger is a computer program that is used to debug other programs. Sometimes, a debugger may also include testing and optimizing functions. For example, when the program crashes, the debugger shows the position in the original code if it is a source-level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly seen in integrated development environments. If it is a low-level debugger or a machine-language debugger, it shows the line in the disassembly. 
Decompiler	Decompiler - A decompiler is a computer program that translates executable programs (the output from a compiler) into an equivalent (relatively) high level language (source code). By comparison, a disassembler translates an executable program into assembly language. 
Deflate Algorithm	Deflate Algorithm - Deflate Algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm that uses a combination of the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding. It was originally defined by Phil Katz for version 2 of his PKZIP archiving tool, and was later specified in RFC 1951. Deflate is used in gzip compressed files and PNG image files, in addition to the ZIP file format for which Katz originally designed it. Source code for Deflate compression and decompression can be found in zlib, the freely available, general-purpose compression library. 
Defragment	Defragment - Defragment is a process often required in a computer system to reorganize the disk by putting files into contiguous order. Because the operating system stores new data in whatever free space is available, data files become spread out across the disk as they are updated. Large files may be broken into many fragments, which will slow down the read/write of hard disks. A deframentation software rewrites all the files and stores them in adjacent sectors. 
Dehardwarization	Dehardwarization - Dehardwarization refers to the trend in design of new computer hardware which tends to eliminate as many hardware components as possible and supplanting their functionality with software. An example of dehardwarized devices include softmodems and many AC'97 based audio cards. 
Delphi	Delphi - Delphi is a programming language and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It is produced by Borland (known for a time as Inprise). The Delphi language, formerly known as Object Pascal (Pascal with object-oriented extensions) originally targeted only Microsoft Windows, but now builds native applications for Linux and the Microsoft .NET framework as well. 
Demo: Demostration Version	Demo: Demostration Version - Demo version, or demostration version, of software is a free or low-priced sample of a program. Demo programs are often with some features disabled or time limitations. It is intended to give the user enough of a taste to want to buy the full version program. 
Demoware	Demoware - Demoware is commercial software released by way of a free download with limitations, that is intended to give the user enough of a taste to want to buy the full version program. Demoware usually is limited in one (or more) of the following ways: 1. Remains functional for a set number of days from installation. 2. May only be launched for a set number of times. 3. Adds identifying marks to the output. Common with image and video editing demoware. 4. Is limited to a set number of days of use (i.e. only days you actually use the program count toward its trial limit) 5. Program execution terminates after a set time period (typically between 5 and 60 minutes). 6. Limited number of times that an important function may be used 
Deprecated Software	Deprecated Software - Deprecated software, also called deprecation, refers to a software or a function inside a software package that is considered obsolete and on its way out, usually in favor of something better. The software or feature still works in the current version, although it may raise alert messages as warnings. These serve to alert the user to the fact that the feature may be removed in future releases, and slowly support for the program is phased out. 
Der Dirigent	Der Dirigent - Der Dirigent is a free (licensed under the GNU General Public License), open source content management system written with PHP and MySQL. It offers full flexibility and extendability while featuring an accomplished set of ready-made interfaces, functions and modules. Der Dirigent has two operating modes: a so-called Frontend which presents Der Dirigent based website to its users and a Backend used by authors and site admins to manage content for the website. After the simple Installation, you need no ftp program. You can do everything in the browser, even the online editing of Cascading Style Sheet or JavaScript. 
Design Compiler	Design Compiler - Design Compiler is a product of Synopsys that compiles and optimises (in terms of silicon area and maximum clock frequency) high-level electronic circuit descriptions specified by restricted sub-languages of either Verilog or VHDL, into a gate-level netlist representation of a circuit. This procedure is an example of logic synthesis. 
DeskScan	DeskScan - DeskScan is Hewlett-Packard software used in conjunction with a scanner. Using DeskScan, pictures or documents can be scanned into the computer (turned into digital files), edited, and placed in one of the right formats to be posted on a Web page or inserted into PowerPoint presentations. 
DesktopBSD	DesktopBSD - DesktopBSD is a UNIX-like, desktop-oriented operating system based on FreeBSD. Its goal is to combine the stability of FreeBSD with the ease-of-use of K Desktop Environment (KDE), which is the default graphical user interface. 
Dev-C++	Dev-C++ - Dev-C++ is a free Integrated Development Environment(IDE) for programming use in C and its derivative, C++. Dev-C++ is bundled with the open source MinGW compiler utilizing gcc and its C++ counterpart, g++. Dev-C++ is distributed under the GNU General Public License. The Dev-C++ IDE is written in Delphi and/or its Linux port of Kylix. 
Device Driver	Device Driver - Device driver, or a software driver, is a specific type of computer software, developed to allow interaction between the computer and hardware devices. Each device driver is typically a piece of operating system-specific as well as hardware-dependent software that makes it possible for application software to attach to, read and write data from, and change the behavior of the peripheral device. Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device, through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to, providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device, and on the other end, the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software applications. Device driver enables another program, typically an operating system or applications software package or computer program running under the operating system kernel, to interact transparently with a hardware device, and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing needs. 
DGCA	DGCA - In computing, DGCA is a freeware compression utility created in 2001 by Shin-ichi Tsuruta. DGCA is also a compressed archive format, the next generation of 'GCA'. DGCA has higher compression than ZIP, Strong Password, Unicode Filename. However, DGCA is not a major compression format. 
DIB: Device-Independent Bitmap	DIB: Device-Independent Bitmap - Device-Independent Bitmap (DIB), also kown as Bitmap (BMP), is the graphics format supported by Windows and some other OS. The graphic files in DIB format are generally end with a .bmp extension. DIB images can also be transferred in metafiles and the clipboard. It's called device-independent because colors are represented in a format independent of the final output device. When a DIB image is output to a specific device, the device driver translates the DIB colors into actual colors that the output device can display. For example, to display bitmap graphs on screen, Device Dependent Bitmap (DDB) must be used. 
Digial pen	Digial pen - Digital pen is an electronic writing instrument that allows the user to digitally capture a handwritten note or drawing. Typically, digital pen is connected with a computer using a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cradle to let the user upload the handwritten notes for processing and storage. The pen looks like a regular ball-point pen and can be used as such, but requires special digital paper if the user wishes to digitally capture what he has written. 
Digital Paper	Digital Paper - Digital paper is patterned paper used in conjunction with a digital pen to create handwritten digital documents. The proprietary printed dot pattern uniquely identifies the position coordinates on the paper. The digital pen uses this pattern to store the handwriting and upload it to a computer. 
Digital Wallet	Digital Wallet - Digital wallet, also known as e-wallet, is a system designed for electronic commerce transactions over the Internet quickly and securely. A digital wallet can hold a user's payment information encrypted, a digital certificate to identify the user, and shipping information to speed transactions. The consumer benefits because their information is encrypted and safe, no retyping required when conduct e-commerce online from different vendors, and payment in digital cash or check. Merchants benefit by receiving protection against fraud. Paypal is an example of such digital wallet system. 
DirectX	DirectX - DirectX, provided by Microsoft, is a suite of multimedia application programming interfaces (APIs) built into Microsoft Windows OS. DirectX provides a standard development platform for Windows-based PCs by enabling software developers to access specialized hardware features without having to write hardware-specific code. The DirectX APIs give multimedia applications access to the advanced features of high-performance hardware such as three-dimensional (3-D) graphics acceleration chips and sound cards. They control low-level functions, including two-dimensional (2-D) graphics acceleration; support for input devices such as joysticks, keyboards, and mice; and control of sound mixing and sound output. Because of DirectX, what you experience with your computer is better 3-D graphics and immersive music and audio effects. 
Disassembly	Disassembly - Disassembly is the process of taking a binary program and deriving the source code from it. 
Disassembler	Disassembler - A disassembler is a computer program which translates machine language to assembly language. It therefore performs the inverse operation to an assembler. However, the output of a disassembler is often designed for human-readability rather than suitability for input to an assembler (called disassembly). By comparison, a decompiler translates machine language into a high level language. 
Distcc	Distcc - Distcc is a computer program that distributes processes of compiling C and its derivatives like C++ and Objective C source code over a computer network. With the right configuration, the program can dramatically reduce compilation time. 
Distiller	Distiller - Distiller is a software program from Adobe which converts postscript files to portable document format (.pdf) files. Postscript files have special coding which instruct the printer how to print the document. 
Distributed Computing	Distributed Computing - Distributed computing may mean different things in different situation. It may refer to the use of multiple computers in an organization rather than one centralized system. This use of the term was popular in the 1970s. It may also mean the use of multiple computers networked throughout a wide geographical area to solve a single problem. 
Distributed Database	Distributed Database - A distributed database is a database that is under the control of a central database management system (DBMS) in which storage devices are not all attached to a common CPU. It may be stored in multiple computers located in the same physical location, or may be dispersed over a network of interconnected computers. Because the database is distributed, different users can access it without interfering with one another. However, the DBMS must periodically synchronize the scattered databases to make sure that they all have consistent data. 
Distribution Software	Distribution Software - Distribution software is a software system that helps companies to manage internal and external resources. Distribution software manages everything from order processing and inventory control to accounting, purchasing and customer service, supply chain management, sales, CRM, inventory, warehouse and finance management. 
DJGPP	DJGPP - DJGPP is a 32-bit C/C++ development system for 386 PCs and PC compatibles running MS-DOS, developed by DJ Delorie in 1989. It is a software port of the popular gcc compiler, as well as many other GNU development utilities, to DOS Protected Mode Interface(DPMI). 
DKBTrace	DKBTrace - DKBTrace was a graphical ray tracing program which was the forerunner of POV-Ray. It had no GUI and ran via the command line. It featured quadric shapes (spheres, ellipsoids, planes, etc), constructive solid geometry (intersection, difference, union), and procedural textures like wood and marble. It was written for UNIX by David K. Buck (1986) and Aaron Collins. The last version (DKBTrace 2.12) was built in 1989. 
DLL Hell	DLL Hell - DLL hell is a phrase used to describe the complications which arise when working with dynamic link libraries (DLLs). DLL Hell encompasses the difficulties of managing dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) in Microsoft Windows operating systems, such as conflicts between DLL versions, difficulty in obtaining required DLLs, and having many unnecessary DLL copies. DLL Hell is an example of a latent operating system design flaw that is, problems occur in well-written programs because of bad programming practice or a bug in poorly-written software that is tolerated by the operating system. The paradigm of a latent operating system flaw is time slice multiplexing in Microsoft operating systems pre-dating OS2 and Windows NT. With time slicing, a rogue or buggy program can effectively disable the entire computer, forcing the user to hard boot the machine. 
DLL: Dynamic-Link Library	DLL: Dynamic-Link Library - Dynamic-link library (DLL) is Microsoft's implementation of the shared library concept in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension DLL, OCX (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or DRV (for legacy system drivers). The file formats for DLLs are the same as for Windows EXE files that is, Portable Executable (PE) for 32-bit Windows, and New Executable (NE) for 16-bit Windows. DLLs can contain code, data, and resources, in any combination. DLL is files containing groups of often-used computer code which can be shared amongst many programs. This has several advantages: programmers who use library code do not need to keep reinventing the wheel; programs which invoke library code do not each need to include a copy of that code, making their files smaller; updates to library code can be applied in one place, rather than in many programs. 
DM: Data Mart	DM: Data Mart - Data mart (DM) is a specialized version of a data warehouse (DW). Whereas a data warehouse combines databases across an entire enterprise, data marts are usually smaller and focus on a particular subject or department. Data marts contain a snapshot of operational data that helps business people to strategize, based on analyses of past trends and experiences. Since a data mart configuration emphasizes easy access to relevant information, the star schema or dimensional model is a fairly popular design choice, as it enables a relational database to emulate the analytical functionality of a multi-dimensional database. 
DM: Data Mining	DM: Data Mining - Data mining (DM), also known as Knowledge-Discovery in Databases (KDD) or Knowledge-Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), is the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for patterns. Data mining uses automated data analysis techniques to uncover previously undetected relationships among data items. Data mining often involves the analysis of data stored in a data warehouse. Three of the major data mining techniques are regression, classification and clustering. 
DML: Data Manipulation Language	DML: Data Manipulation Language - Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a family of computer languages used by computer programs or database users to retrieve, insert, delete and update data in a database. The currently most popular Data manipulation language is that of SQL, which is used to retrieve and manipulate data in a Relational database. Other forms of DML are those used by IMS/DL1, CODASYL databases (such as IDMS), and others. 
DMX: Data Mining Extensions	DMX: Data Mining Extensions - Data Mining Extensions (DMX) is a query language for Data Mining Models, much like that SQL is a query language for relational databases and MDX is a query language for OLAP databases. DMX syntax is more similar to SQL than MDX. 
Doc-O-Matic	Doc-O-Matic - Doc-O-Matic is a commercial automatic documentation generator that creates fully cross linked documentation systems, including both Source Code Documentation, Online Help and User Manuals in PDF, browser-based Help, HTML Help, MS Help 2, Windows Help, RTF and XML. Doc-O-Matic supports all major project file formats as well as the following programming languages: C/C++, C++/CLI, C#, Delphi, Java, IDL, VB.NET, JavaScript, MATLAB, ASP.NET, JSP. 
Document! X	Document! X - Document! X is a documentation generator which automates technical documentation production for VB6/VBA source code, C#/VB.NET/C++ or other .NET language assemblies, databases, COM components, type libraries and XSD schemas. Document! X consists of an authoring and documentation built environment (including HTML based Visual Authoring tools) as well as Visual Comment Editor Add-Ins for Visual Basic, VBA and Visual Studio .NET. 
DOMi: DOM Inspector	DOMi: DOM Inspector - DOM Inspector (DOMi) is one of the web developer tools included in Mozilla Application Suite and Mozilla Firefox. The main function of the DOM Inspector is to inspect the Document Object Model tree of HTML and XML-based documents. 
Donateware	Donateware - Donateware (or donationware) is freely distribution software. But the user must donate to a charitable cause in order to register the software. Sometimes the author of the program stipulates which charity the user must donate to, sometimes they just suggest one, and sometimes the author leaves the choice up to the user. Normally the user does not need to contact the author with any information in order to register their program - it is implicit with the donation (registering does not unlock any extra features). 
DOOM	DOOM - DOOM is a 1993 computer game by id Software that is among the landmark titles in the first-person shooter genre. It is widely recognized for its pioneering use of immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and the support for players to create custom expansions (WADs). Distributed as shareware, Doom was downloaded by an estimated 10 million people within two years, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture; as a sign of its impact on the industry, games from the mid-1990s boom of first-person shooters are often known simply as Doom clones. Its graphic and interactive violence has also made Doom the subject of much controversy reaching outside the gaming world. 
Doom WAD	Doom WAD - Doom WADs (Where's All the Data?) are mods for the computer game Doom or its sequel Doom II. Immediately after its release in 1993, Doom attracted a sizeable following of players who created their own WAD files packages containing levels, graphics and other game data and played a vital part in spawning the mod-making culture which is now commonplace for first-person shooters. Literally thousands of WADs, ranging from single custom levels to full original games, have been created for Doom; most of these can be downloaded for free over the Internet. Several WADs have also been released commercially, and for some people the WAD-making hobby became a gateway to a professional career as a level designer. 
DOS: Disk Operating System	DOS: Disk Operating System - Disk Operating System (DOS) commonly refers to the family of closely related operating systems which dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 2000: PC-DOS, MS-DOS, FreeDOS, DR-DOS, Novell-DOS, OpenDOS, PTS-DOS, ROM-DOS and several others. Of these, MS-DOS from Microsoft was the most widely used. These operating systems ran on IBM PC type hardware using the Intel x86 CPUs or their compatible cousins from other makers. Such a system must handle physical disk I/O, the mapping of file names to disk addresses and protection of files from unauthorised access (in a multi-user system). DOS should present a uniform interface to different storage device such as floppy disks, hard disks and magnetic tape drives. It may also provide some kind of locking to prevent unintentional simultaneous access by two processes to the same file (or record). 
DotGNU	DotGNU - DotGNU is a GNU-sponsored project for devising web services, software componentry and the like. It is compatible with Microsoft .NET and similar to the Mono project from Novell.The DotGNU developers say that while they realize that the Microsoft .NET platform is a powerful concept, its commercialization by a single company may be threatening the free software movement. There are nonetheless a lot of open source projects being made in C#. 
DotNetNuke	DotNetNuke - DotNetNuke is a free, open source, extensible content management system ideal for creating and maintaining professional websites. Originally based on the iBuySpy code demo released by Microsoft, the system is now in its 3rd edition. You customize the look and feel of your site by creating one or more Skins that require little more than HTML knowledge to create. Like many other Content Management Systems, the power of DotNetNuke lies not so much in its built-in features but its easy extensibility. 
Doxygen	Doxygen - Doxygen is a Documentation generator for C++, C, Java, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent Objective-C, PHP, C# and D. Being highly portable, it runs on most Unix systems as well as on Windows and Mac OS X. Most of the Doxygen code was written by Dimitri van Heesch. 
Drawing Program	Drawing Program - Drawing program allows a user to draw freehand and create complex graphics. It may include features such as special fonts, clip art, or painting facilities that allow a user to simulate on the computer the drawing characteristics of specific real-world implements such as charcoal, watercolours, or pastels. For example, Corel Draw and Adobe Illustrator are drawing programs. 
DRDA: Distributed Relational Database Architecture	DRDA: Distributed Relational Database Architecture - Distributed Relational Database Architecture is an IBM proprietary architecture for relational database. 
Dreamweaver	Dreamweaver - Dreamweaver is an HTML editor developed by Macromedia, now part of Adobe Systems. It was originally designed for professional web designers and offers an editing system that combines both the productivity of WYSIWYG design with the control of HTML code editing mode. This combination was quite unique in late 1990s and helped Dreamweaver to a widespread adoption. It is currently available for Mac and Windows and holds about 80% of the professional HTML editor market. 
Dribbleware	Dribbleware - Dribbleware refers to the software which is prematurely released with frequent update, fixes, and patches after release. With the intense market pressure to release software products as soon as possible, and with the increased ease of updating software via Internet downloads, dribbleware is becoming the norm rather than the exception. 
Driver Wrapper	Driver Wrapper - A driver wrapper is software that functions as an adapter between an operating system and a driver, such as a device driver, that was not designed for that operating system. It can enable the operating system to use technologies for which no native implementation exists. 
Drupal	Drupal - Drupal is a content management framework, content management system and blogging engine which was originally written by Dries Buytaert as a bulletin board system. Drupal has become much more, thanks to its flexible architecture, and is the software used to power Debian Planet, Terminus1525, Wikinerds Portal, Spread Firefox, and KernelTrap, among others. Drupal is written in PHP using strict coding standards. 
DSI: Delivered Source Instruction	DSI: Delivered Source Instruction - Delivered source instruction (DSI) refers to one line of new source code developed for software. DSI is used to estimate software cost. Typically expressed in thousands of lines of code (e.g., 5,000 DSI or 5KDSI). DSI is the primary input to many tools for estimating software cost. The term delivered is generally meant to exclude non-delivered support software such as test drivers. However, if these are developed with the same care as delivered software, with their own reviews, test plans, documentation, etc., then they should be counted. The source instructions include all program instructions created by project personnel and processed into machine code by some combination of preprocessors, compilers, and assemblers. It excludes comments and unmodified utility software. It includes job control language, format statements, and data declarations. 
DSL: Domain-Specific Language	DSL: Domain-Specific Language - Domain-specific language(DSL), also known as domain-specific programming language, is a programming language designed to be useful for a specific set of tasks. Examples of DSLs include spreadsheet macros, YACC for parsing and compilers, Csound, a language used to create audio files, and GraphViz, a language used to define directed graphs, and create a visual representation of that graph. DSLs have also been called by various names: Little languages, Macros, Application languages, Very high level languages, etc. 
DSSI: Disposable Soft Synth Interface	DSSI: Disposable Soft Synth Interface - Disposable Soft Synth Interface (DSSI) is a virtual instrument (software synthesizer) plugin architecture for use by music sequencer applications. It was designed for applications running under Linux, although there is nothing specific to Linux in the interface itself. It is sometimes described as LADSPA for instruments. LADSPA is the more general plugin architecture for filters, reverbs and other sound processing software tools, whereas DSSI is specifically for instruments. DSSI, however, uses LADSPA as an event transport mechanism and as such extends LADSPA. 
DW: Data Warehouse	DW: Data Warehouse - Data warehouse (DW) is a computer database that collects, integrates and stores an organization's data with the aim of producing accurate and timely management information and supporting data analysis. A DW typically has the following characters: 1) SUBJECT oriented, meaning that the data in the database is organised so that all the data elements relating to the same real-world event or object are linked together; 2) Time variant, meaning that the changes to the data in the database are tracked and recorded so that reports can be produced showing changes over time; 3) Non-volatile, meaning that data in the database is never over-written or deleted, but retained for future reporting; and, 4) Integrated, meaning that the database contains data from most or all of an organisation's operational applications, and that this data is made consistent.
EBNF: Extended Backus Naur form	EBNF: Extended Backus Naur form - Extended BackusNaur form (EBNF) is an extension and simplification of the original Backus Naur form (BNF) metasyntax notation. Originally developed by Niklaus Wirth, the most commonly used variants of EBNF are currently defined by standards, most notably ISO-14977. 
ECM: Enterprise Content Management	ECM: Enterprise Content Management - Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is any of the strategies and technologies employed in the information technology industry for managing the capture, storage, security, revision control, retrieval, distribution, preservation and destruction of documents and content. ECM especially concerns content imported into or generated from within an organization in the course of its operation, and includes the control of access to this content from outside of the organization's processes. 
Editor	Editor - Editor in computing refers to an application program that enables you to create and edit some types of files. There are many different types of editors, such as: text editor, an application to edit plain text; hex editor, an application to edit binary data; HTML editor, an application to edit webpages; XML editor, an application to edit XML data; digital audio editor, an application to edit audio data; raster graphics editor; vector graphics editor; level editor, an application to edit levels of computer games; etc. 
EFence: Electric Fence	EFence: Electric Fence - Electric Fence (eFence) is a memory debugger written by Bruce Perens. It consists of a library which a programmer can link into his or her code to override the standard library memory management functions. eFence triggers a program crash when the memory error occurs, so a debugger can be used to inspect the code that caused the error. 
EFSM: Extended Finite State Machine Model	EFSM: Extended Finite State Machine Model - Extended Finite State Machine Model (EFSM) is an enhanced model based on the traditional finite state machine (FSM), which is a model of behavior composed of states, transitions and actions. In a conventional FSM, the transition is associated with a set of input Boolean conditions & a set of output Boolean functions. In an EFSM model, the transition can be expressed by an if statement. If trigger conditions are all satisfied, the transition is fired, bringing the machine from the current state to the next state and performing the specified data operations. The models are used widely in modeling reactive systems, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, biology, mathematics, and logic. 
EGCS: Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System	EGCS: Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System - Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System(EGCS) was a compiler system which forked from the GNU Compiler System (GCC) in 1997 and was re-merged in April 1999. By 1991, GCC 1.x had reached a point of stability, but architectural limitations prevented many desired improvements, so the Free Software Foundation started to work on GCC 2.x. 
EIAS: Electric Image Animation System	EIAS: Electric Image Animation System - The Electric Image Animation System (EIAS) is a 3D computer graphics package published by EI Technology Group. It currently runs on the Mac OS X, Windows, and Solaris platforms. EIAS's primary competitors in the integrated 3D package space are Autodesk with Maya and 3D Studio Max, Avid with Softimage|XSI, Maxon with Cinema 4D, and Newtek with LightWave 3D. 
Emacs	Emacs - Emacs is a class of text editors, possessing an extensive set of features, that are popular with computer programmers and other technically proficient computer users. Many versions of Emacs have appeared since 1975 when the original version was introduced, but nowadays there are two that are commonly used: GNU Emacs, started by Richard Stallman in 1984 and still maintained by him, and XEmacs, a fork of GNU Emacs which was started in 1991 and has remained mostly compatible. Both use a powerful extension language, Emacs Lisp, that allows them to handle tasks ranging from writing and compiling computer programs to browsing the web. 
Emacs LISP	Emacs LISP - Emacs LISP is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used by the GNU Emacs and XEmacs text editors (which will be collectively referred to as Emacs in this article.) It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C. Users of Emacs commonly write Emacs Lisp code to customize and extend Emacs. 
Emulation	Emulation - Emulation refers to the capabilities of a program or device to imitate another program or device. Emulation attempts to model, to various degrees, the state of the device being emulated. Emulation tricks other systems into believing that the device is really some other emulated device. A example of emulation is to mimic the experience of running arcade games or console games on personal computers. In a networked environment, a computer acts as if it is another kind of computer or terminal. For example, a PC user opens a remote terminal session to a Unix, so it may run a program that emulates an Unix terminal. 
Emulation Mode	Emulation Mode - Emulation Mode is an operational state of a computer when it is running a foreign program under emulation. For example, a PC user opens a remote terminal session to a Unix, and it may run a program that emulates an Unix terminal. 
Emulator	Emulator - Emulator is a software or hardware device with emulation program to imitate another program or device. A software emulator allows computer programs to run on a platform (computer architecture and/or operating system) other than the one for which they were originally written. A hardware emulator is an emulator which takes the form of a hardware device. Examples include printer emulators inside the ROM of the printer, and FPGA-based emulators. 
Enterprise Software	Enterprise Software - Enterprise Software is a type of software that solves an enterprise wide problem (rather than a departmental problem) and usually enterprise software is written using Enterprise Software Architecture. Due to the cost of building what is often proprietary software only large organizations attempt to build software that models the entire business enterprise and is the core system of governing the enterprise and the core of business communications within the enterprise. Enterprise software is often categorized by the business function that it automates - such as accounting software, human resource management or sales force automation software. It also varies by industry verticals due to common business processes within a specific industry. There are enterprise systems devised for health care, for example, or for manufacturing enterprises. 
Enterprise Software Architecture	Enterprise Software Architecture - Enterprise Software Architecture, also known as Enterprise Architecture, is the practice of applying a comprehensive and rigorous method for describing a current and/or future structure and behaviour for an organization's processes, information systems, personnel and organizational sub-units, so that they align with the organization's core goals and strategic direction. Although often associated strictly with information technology, it relates more broadly to the practice of business optimization in that it addresses business architecture, performance management and process architecture as well. 
Entropy	Entropy - Entropy, a concept in physics, is a measrue of disorder or randomness of a system. In data compression, it is a measure of the amount of non-redundant and non-compressible data in an object (the amount that is not similar). In encryption, it is the amount of disorder or randomness that is added. In software, it is the disorder and jumble of its logic, which occurs after the program has been modified over and over. 
ESC/Java: Extended Static Checker for Java	ESC/Java: Extended Static Checker for Java - Extended Static Checker for Java (ESC/Java) is a Compaq (now part of HP) programming tool that attempts to find common run-time errors in Java programs by static analysis of the program text. Users can control the amount and kinds of checking by annotating their programs with specially formatted comments or pragmas. 
Etnus TotalView	Etnus TotalView - Etnus TotalView is a debugger for Unix-like and Mac OS X systems and supports C/C++ and Fortran. It allows process control down to the single thread, the ability to look at data for a single thread or all threads at the same time, and the ability to synchronize threads through breakpoints. TotalView integrates memory leak detection and other heap memory debugging features. Data analysis features help find anomalies and problems in the target program's data, and the combination of visualization and evaluation points let the user watch data change as the program executes. 
Evaluation Strategy	Evaluation Strategy - An evaluation strategy (or reduction strategy) for a programming language is a set of (usually deterministic) rules for defining the evaluation of expressions under I2-reduction. Emphasis is typically placed on functions or operators an evaluation strategy defines when and in what order the arguments to a function are evaluated, when they are substituted into the function, and what form that substitution takes. A language may combine several evaluation strategies; for example, C++ combines call-by-value with call-by-reference. Most languages that are predominantly strict use some form of non-strict evaluation for boolean expressions and if-statements. 
Exec Shield	Exec Shield - Exec Shield is a security patch for the Linux kernel that adds an NX bit to x86 CPUs. It was developed by Ingo Molnar of Red Hat, and is used as a part of Fedora Core 1, 2 and 3. Exec Shield attempts to flag data memory as non-executable and program memory as non-writeable. This suppresses many security exploits, such as those stemming from buffer overflows and other techniques relying on overwriting data and inserting code into those structures. Exec Shield also supplies some address space layout randomization for the mmap() and heap base. 
Extended ASCII	Extended ASCII - Extended ASCII, also known as high ASCII, is a set of codes using 8 bits for each character, instead of 7 bits as the basic ASCII set. The basic ASCII set provides it a total of 128 unique symbols. The extended ASCII character set gives it an additional 128 characters. The extra characters represent characters from foreign languages and special symbols for drawing pictures. 
EXtensible Markup Language (XML)	EXtensible Markup Language (XML) - Extensible Markup Language (XML), a subset of SGML, defines a syntax that lets you create markup languages to specify information structures. Information structures define the type of information, for example, subscriber name or address, not how the information looks (bold, italic, and so on). External processes can manipulate these information structures and publish them in a variety of formats. Text markup language designed to enable the use of SGML on the World Wide Web. XML allows you to define your own customized markup language. XML tags are not predefined. You must define your own tags. XML uses a Document Type Definition (DTD) or an XML Schema to describe the data. XML is not a replacement for HTML. Actually, XML and HTML are complimentary to each other. 
External Command	External Command - In DOS and OS/2, external command is a function performed by a separate utility program that accompanies the operating system. Contrast with internal command. 
Extreme Programming	Extreme Programming - Extreme Programming (XP) is a software engineering methodology developed by Kent Beck, the most prominent of several agile software development methodologies. It prescribes a set of day-to-day practices for developers and managers; the practices are meant to embody and encourage particular values. Extreme Programming is effectively used with small teams of developers who need to develop software quickly in an environment of rapidly-changing requirements. 
EZ Publish	EZ Publish - EZ publish is a popular enterprise open source (under the GNU GPL license) content management system (CMS) and development framework, developed, distributed, and supported by eZ systems with input and help from an active user and developer community.

FASM: Flat Assembler	FASM: Flat Assembler - Flat Assembler(FASM) is a free, multiple-pass, Intel-style assembler supporting the IA-32 and x86-64 architectures. FASM is written in assembly language, comes with full source. The project was started in 1999 by Tomasz Grysztar. It is noted for its fast speed, size optimizations, portability, powerful macro capabilities, and online forum community. However, it uses (almost) no command-line options. Binaries/sources are available for Linux, Windows (w/ IDE), DOS, OpenBSD etc., MenuetOS, OctaOS, and Dex4u. FASM contains bindings to the Windows GUI and OpenGL. All versions of FASM can directly output any of the following: flat binary, ELF or COFF (classic or MS) objects, or executables in either MZ, ELF or PE format. An unofficial port targeting the ARM architecture (FASMARM) exists. 
FAST: Federation Against Software Theft	FAST: Federation Against Software Theft - Federation Against Software Theft(FAST) is a non-profit organisation, formed in 1984 by the software industry with the aim of eradicating software theft in the UK. In addition to prosecuting organisations and individuals for software theft, FAST set up a campaign of public education and awareness to ensure that users of commercial software understand the effects of software theft. FAST gives a member organisation, which has signed a Code of Ethics and is committed to the carrying out of a regular software audit, a period of grace before bringing action if there is evidence of irregularities by the member organisation. 
FastCAD	FastCAD - FastCAD is a 2D and 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) program for Windows, which uses FCW as the file extension. It includes 3d modeling and rendering, symbol definition editing, and advanced capabilities for working with multiple drawings and overlays.

FAT: File Allocation Table	FAT: File Allocation Table - File Allocation Table (FAT) is file system developed by Microsoft for MS-DOS and is the primary file system for consumer versions of Microsoft Windows up to Windows Me. The FAT file system is an ideal format for floppy disks and solid-state memory cards, and a convenient way of sharing data between disparate operating systems installed on the same computer (a dual boot environment). FAT is replaced by New Technology File System (NTFS) since the release of Windows NT. 
Fat Binary	Fat Binary - A fat binary, also known as multiarchitecture binary, is a computer program that is native to multiple instruction set architectures (ISA) and thus can be run on multiple processor types. The usual method of implementation is to include a version of the machine code for each ISA, resulting in a file n times larger than a normal one-architecture binary. 
Fetch-and-add CPU instruction	Fetch-and-add CPU instruction - Fetch-and-add CPU instruction is a special instruction that automatically modifies the contents of a memory location. It is used to implement Mutual exclusion and concurrent algorithms in multiprocessor systems. 
Fibonacci Number Program	Fibonacci Number Program - Fibonacci number program is a popular program in many beginning computer science courses, introducing the concept of recursion by calculating and printing the Fibonacci numbers. In general, however, a recursive algorithm to compute Fibonacci numbers is extremely inefficient when compared to other algorithms, such as iterative or matrix equation algorithms. 
Fibonacci Numbers	Fibonacci Numbers - In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers is a sequence of numbers defined recursively by the Fibonacci rule: after two starting values, each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. For example, the first Fibonacci numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, are - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946 
Fifth-Generation Programming Language	Fifth-Generation Programming Language - Fifth-generation programming language (5GL) is a programming language based around solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer. Most constraint-based and logic programming languages and some declarative languages are fifth-generation languages. Fifth-generation languages are used mainly in artificial intelligence research. Prolog, OPS5, and Mercury are the best known fifth-generation languages. 
FileMaker Pro	FileMaker Pro - FileMaker Pro is a desktop-based relational database management system from FileMaker Inc., similar to Microsoft Access. FileMaker was one of a handful of database applications released on the Apple Macintosh in the 1980s. 
Filename Extension	Filename Extension - Filename extension is a portion of a filename, following the point after the individual file name. Filename extenson indicates the type of data stored in the file. Many operating systems use filename extensions, e.g. Unix,MS-DOS. Examples include c for C source code, doc for Miscrosft word, ps for PostScript, txt for text fle, etc. 
Fiora	Fiora - Fiora was a Computer role-playing game originally inspired by various bots floating around IRC's EsperNet servers. It took many elements from Tactics Ogre, and derived its turn system from different aspects of James Iyouboushi's Kaiou bot and Craig's Future bot. 
FireFox	FireFox - Firefox, also known as Mozilla Firefox, is a free, open source, cross-platform, graphical web browser developed by the Mozilla Corporation and hundreds of volunteers. Firefox includes an integrated pop-up blocker, tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, support for open standards, and an extension mechanism for adding functionality. Although other browsers have some of these features, Firefox became the first such browser to include them all and achieve wide adoption. 
Firmware	Firmware - Firmware is software that is embedded in a hardware device. It is often provided on flash ROMs or as a binary image file that can be uploaded onto existing hardware by a user. The firmware typically implements a portion of the network protocols, security mechanisms and administrative capabilities of the hardware device. 
First Generation Programming Language	First Generation Programming Language - First-generation programming language(1GL) is a machine-level programming language, which was written in 1s and 0s. There is no compiler or translator required and it can be understood and used by a CPU directly. The code using 1GL can run very fast and efficiently since it is directly executed by the CPU. However, machine language is somewhat more difficult to learn than higher generational programming languages, and it is far more difficult to edit if errors occur. Furthermore code portability is significantly reduced in the 1GL based code. First-generation programming language is mainly used now on very ancient computers. Machine level programming still finds a use in several areas of modern programming with the help of native-code compilers which creates machine language, usually from a higher-level language. 
FLAC: Free Lossless Audio Codec	FLAC: Free Lossless Audio Codec - Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is a popular free audio compression codec that is lossless. Unlike lossy codecs such as MP3 and AAC, it does not remove any information from the audio stream and is suitable both for everyday playback and for archiving audio collections. Free means that the specification of the stream format can be implemented by anyone without prior permission, and that neither the FLAC format nor any of the implemented encoding/decoding methods is covered by any patent. The sources for libFLAC and libFLAC++ are available under Xiph.org's BSD license and the sources for flac, metaflac, and the plugins are available under the GPL. 
Flex Lexical Analyser Generator	Flex Lexical Analyser Generator - The Flex lexical analyser generator (Flex) is a free software alternative to Lex. Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical patterns in text. Flex reads the given input files, or its standard input if no file names are given, for a description of a scanner to generate.
FMV: Full Motion Video	FMV: Full Motion Video - Full motion video (FMV) is a popular term for pre-recorded TV-quality movie or animation in a video game. FMV is simply a playback of something that was previously recorded. With modern computer hardware, games are rendered at much higher resolutions than typical FMVs, resulting in FMVs being easily spottable as lower quality than the game itself. In this case, while a pre-rendered FMV may use more advanced effects than possible in-game, it is considered lower quality due to being seen at a lower resolution. 
FOP: Formatting Objects Processor	FOP: Formatting Objects Processor - Formatting Objects Processor(FOP) is an XSL-FO processor written in Java, which provides the feature to convert XSL-FO files to PDF or direct-printable-files. FOP was originally developed by James Tauber who donated it to the Apache Software Foundation in 1999. It is part of the Apache XML project. 
FORTRAN	FORTRAN - FORTRAN is the oldest high-level programming language, designed by John Backus for IBM in the late 1950s. FORTRAN is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. It is still in use today, particularly for scientific applications that require extensive mathematical computations. The two most common versions of FORTRAN are FORTRAN IV and FORTRAN 77. A new ISO and ANSI standard for FORTRAN, called FORTRAN-90, was developed in the early 90s. 
Forward Compatible	Forward Compatible - Forward compatible, also known as upward compatible, refers to software that runs not only on the computer for which it was designed, but also on newer and more powerful models. Forward compatibility is important because it means you can move to a newer, larger, and more sophisticated computer without converting your data. An example of upward/forward compatibility is the specification that a web browser ignore HTML tags not recognised. Ignoring data or application instructions not recognized is the typical behavior of forward compatible systems. 
Fourier Transform	Fourier Transform - The Fourier Transform, named after Joseph Fourier, is an integral transform that re-expresses a function in terms of sinusoidal basis functions, i.e. as a sum or integral of sinusoidal functions multiplied by some coefficients (amplitudes). Fourier Transform technique is used to evaluate the importance of various frequency cycles in a time series pattern. 
Fourth-Generation Language	Fourth-Generation Language - A fourth-generation programming language (4GL) is a programming language closer to human languages than typical high-level programming languages. Such languages arose after the introduction of modern, block-structured third-generation programming languages, which improved the process of software development. Most 4GLs are used to access databases. For example, a typical 4GL command is FIND ALL RECORDS WHERE COMPANY IS JAVVIN. 
FPA: Function Point Analysis	FPA: Function Point Analysis - Function point analysis (FPA) is a method used to gauge the size and complexity of computer software, employing a function point as a unit of measure. Function points are a unit measure for software size, much like an hour is to measure time. 
Free Software	Free Software - Free software, according to the definition of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), refers to the software that everyone is free to copy, redistribute and modify. That implies that it must be available as source code. It does not imply that it is free of charge, so anyone can sell free software so long as they don't impose any new restrictions on its redistribution or use. 
Free Software License	Free Software License - Free software license refers to a license which grants permissions to the recipient to remove any ownership issues which would otherwise prevent the software from being free software. With free software license, recipients of the software is granted the freedom to modify and redistribute the software by the copyright holder.

Support for the ARM and MIPS architectures is currently in development. 
FreeDoom	FreeDoom - FreeDoom is a Doom WAD file intended to be used instead of the copyrighted file from the original Doom and Doom II. The idea is that since the source to Doom is released as open source you can combine the free game engine with the free WAD to create an entirely free game. This also makes it possible to use all user-made WADs that require the original (and copyrighted) WAD by replacing it.

FrontPage is a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor, meaning that you can create the Web page exactly as you want it to look on the screen, and the program adds the HTML source code necessary to make sure that the page looks right in a Web browser. 
FSF: Free Software Foundation	FSF: Free Software Foundation - Free Software Foundation(FSF) is an organisation devoted to the creation and dissemination of free software, i.e. software that is free from licensing fees or restrictions on use. The Foundation's main work is supporting the GNU project with a basic belief that information is community property and all software source should be shared. 
FSM: Finite State Machine	FSM: Finite State Machine - A finite state machine (FSM) or finite automaton is a model of behavior composed of states, transitions and actions. A state stores information about the past, i.e. it reflects the input changes from the system start to the present moment. A transition indicates a state change and is described by a condition that would need to be fulfilled to enable the transition. An action is a description of an activity that is to be performed at a given moment. In addition to their use in modeling reactive systems, finite state automata are significant in many different areas, including linguistics, computer science, philosophy, biology, mathematics, and logic. 
FSML: Financial Services Markup Language	FSML: Financial Services Markup Language - Financial Services Markup Language(FSML), a data description language based on the metalanguage Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), was developed to create financial documents for delivery over the Internet, including eCheck and their associated documentation. FSML is a set of markup symbols or codes that allows its users to define the individual items that compose a document, assemble items into larger document parts that take on a contextual meaning, and enable the screening of a document for digital signatures, endorsement, additions, or deletions. 
FTP Client	FTP Client - FTP client is a software installed on a workstation which uses the FTP protocol to connect to an FTP server to transfer files. Basic FTP clients are part of operating systems, including Windows, DOS, Linux and Unix. However, many enhanced clients are available typically as shareware/freeware for Windows and as free software for Unix-like systems. Many web browsers have built-in FTP clients as well. Commercial FTP clients also exist with high performance or advanced features. 
Functional Programming	Functional Programming - Functional programming is a programming paradigm that conceives computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. Functional programming emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to imperative programming, which emphasizes changes in state and the execution of sequential commands. Functional programming is defined more by a set of common concerns and themes than any list of distinctions from other paradigms. Often considered important are higher-order and first-class functions, closures, and recursion. Other common features of functional programming languages are continuations, Hindley-Milner type inference systems, non-strict evaluation (including, but not limited to, laziness), and monads. 
Functional Programming Language	Functional Programming Language - Functional programming languages, based on the functional programming paradigm, is a type of programming languages that consist of a set of (possibly recursive) function definitions and an expression whose value is output as the program's result. Functional programing languages are one kind of declarative language. They are based on the typed lambda calculus with constants. There are no side-effects to expression evaluation so an expression. Furthermore, an expression can always be replaced by its value without changing the overall result (referential transparency). Functional programming languages have largely been emphasized in academia rather than in commercial software development. Notable exceptions are Erlang (highly-concurrent telecom applications), J and K (financial analysis), and domain-specific programming languages like XSLT. Important influences on functional programming have been the lambda calculus, the APL programming language, the Lisp programming language, and more recently the Haskell programming language.
GA: Global Arrays	GA: Global Arrays - The Global Arrays (GA) is a public domain toolkit that provides an efficient and portable shared-memory programming interface for distributed-memory computers. Unlike other shared-memory environments, the GA model exposes to the programmer the non-uniform memory access (NUMA) characteristics of the high performance computers and acknowledges that access to a remote portion of the shared data is slower than to the local portion. The locality information for the shared data is available, and a direct access to the local portions of shared data is provided. Global Arrays have been designed to complement rather than substitute for the message-passing programming model. The programmer is free to use both the shared-memory and message-passing paradigms in the same program, and to take advantage of existing message-passing software libraries. Global Arrays are compatible with the Message Passing Interface (MPI). 
GAMS: General Algebraic Modeling System	GAMS: General Algebraic Modeling System - The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is a high-level modeling system for mathematical programming problems.

GML: Generalized Markup Language	GML: Generalized Markup Language - Generalized Markup Language (GML) is a set of macros (tags) for the IBM text formatter, SCRIPT. SCRIPT is the main component of IBM's Document Composition Facility (DCF). GML simplifies the description of a document in terms of its format, organization structure and content parts and their relationship, and other properties. GML markup (or tags) describe such parts as chapters, important sections, and less important sections (by specifying heading levels), paragraphs, lists, tables, and so forth. Using GML, a document is marked up with tags that define what the text is, in terms of paragraphs, headers, lists, tables, and so forth. The document can then be automatically formatted for various devices simply by specifying a profile for the device. For example, it is possible to format a document for a laser printer or a line (dot matrix) printer or for a screen simply by specifying a profile for the device without changing the document itself.

These tools form an integrated system that is used for programming both applications and operating systems. Parts of the toolchain are also widely used in the Solaris Operating Environment (which, in the opinion of many, needs the GNU tools for reasonable usability) and Microsoft Windows programming with Cygwin and MinGW/MSYS. Projects that are included in the GNU toolchain: - GNU make - build and compilation automation - The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) - compilers for several languages - The GNU Binutils - linker, assembler and other tools - The GNU Debugger (GDB) - an interactive debugger - The GNU build system (autotools) - Autoconf, Autoheader, Automake, Libtool - makefiles generators 
GNU/kFreeBSD	GNU/kFreeBSD - GNU/kFreeBSD is an operating system that uses the kernel of FreeBSD in conjunction with GNU userland software. Currently, the following distributions of GNU/kFreeBSD are available: Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, Gentoo/FreeBSD. It should be noted that the k in kFreeBSD refers to the fact that only the kernel of the FreeBSD operating system is used. 
GNU/Linux	GNU/Linux - GNU/Linux, simply called Linux in most cases, refers to all the variants GNU operating systems using the Linux kernel. 
GNU/NetBSD	GNU/NetBSD - GNU/NetBSD is a term for an operating system using the NetBSD kernel but GNU userland software, like Debian GNU/NetBSD, a Debian version currently available for IA-32 and Alpha architectures. 
GNU: Gnu's Not UNIX	GNU: Gnu's Not UNIX - GNU, a recursive acronym for GNU's Not UNIX, is a project sponsored by the Free Software Foundation that develops and maintains a complete free UNIX like software environment including operating system kernel and utilities, editor, compiler and debugger. Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as Linux, they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems. 
GNUstep	GNUstep - GNUstep is a free software implementation of NeXT's OpenStep Objective-C libraries (called frameworks), widget toolkit, and application development tools not only for Unix-like operating systems, but also for Microsoft Windows. It is part of the GNU project. 
Goto	Goto - Goto, also spelled as go to, GO TO, GOTO, is a construct and keyword found in several higher-level programming languages (e.g. Fortran, COBOL, BASIC, C) to cause an unconditional jump or transfer of control from one point in a program to another. The destination of the jump is usually indicated by a parameter after the command. 
GPL: General Public License	GPL: General Public License - General Public License(GPL) is a free license type applied to most software from the Free Software Foundation(FSF) and the GNU project and other authors who choose to use it. The normal licences as defined by the copyright law are designed to prevent users from sharing or changing it. By contrast, the General Public License is intended to provide the freedom to share and change software - to make sure the software including source code is open and free for all its users, distributors and modifiers (as long as the changes are clearly marked, the derivative work is not sold and is also licensed under the GPL.) 
GPL: General Purpose Language	GPL: General Purpose Language - General Purpose Language(GPL), also known as general purpose programming language, is a programming language that can be used for any purposes. Examples of DSLs include C, C++, BASIC, FORTRAN, etc. 
GPS: GNAT Programming Studio	GPS: GNAT Programming Studio - GNAT Programming Studio (GPS), formerly known as the GNAT Programming System, is a free multi-language IDE for GNU/Linux, MS Windows and Solaris/Sparc. GPS uses GTK+ as graphical user interface. This IDE is released by AdaCore under the GNAT Modified General Public License. 
Greenware	Greenware - Greenware is a software license which provides an end user with the right to use a particular program or obtain the source code, if he makes an effort to help out the environment such as using only recycled computer paper, recycling the computer paper after using it, using public transport, etc. 
Greyware	Greyware - Greyware refers to a malicious software or code that is considered to fall in the grey area between normal software and a virus. Greyware is a term for which all other malicious or annoying software such as adware, spyware, trackware, and other malicious code and malicious shareware fall under. 
Groupware	Groupware - Groupware, also known as Collaborative software, is a type of computer software or computer-based systems that support groups of people engaged in a common task (or goal) and that provide an interface to a shared environment. It is the basis for computer supported cooperative work. Such software systems as mail, calendaring, chat, wiki belong into this category. 
GSL: GNU Scientific Library	GSL: GNU Scientific Library - GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a software library written in the C programming language for numerical calculations in applied mathematics and science. The GSL is part of the GNU project and is distributed under the GNU GPL. 
GTK+: GIMP Toolkit	GTK+: GIMP Toolkit - GIMP Toolkit (GTK+), licensed under the LGPL as a free (and open source) software, is one of the two most popular widget toolkits for the X Window System, intended for creating graphical user interfaces. GTK+ and Qt have supplanted Motif, previously the most widely-used X widget toolkit. GTK+ uses the C programming language, although its designers use an object-oriented paradigm. The GNOME platform bindings provide for C++ (gtkmm), Perl, Ruby, Java and Python (PyGTK) bindings; others have written bindings for many other programming languages (including Ada, D, Haskell, Pascal, PHP, and all .NET programming languages). 
GTK-Qt	GTK-Qt - The GTK-Qt Theme Engine is a project allowing GTK to use Qt widget styles. It behaves like a normal GTK theme engine, but calls functions from Qt instead of doing the drawing itself. 
GUI: Graphical User Interface	GUI: Graphical User Interface - A graphical user interface (GUI) is a method of human interacting with a computer through direct manipulation of graphical images and widgets in addition to text. A program with a GUI runs under some windowing system (e.g. The X Window System, Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, Acorn RISC OS, NEXTSTEP). The program displays certain icons, buttons, dialogue boxes etc. in its windows on the screen and the user controls it mainly by moving a pointer on the screen (typically controlled by a mouse) and selecting certain objects by pressing buttons on the mouse while the pointer is pointing at them. 
Guiltware	Guiltware - Guiltware refers to the kind of shareware software that attempts to make the user register and pay for the software by exploiting the user's sense of guilt. For example, when people are using a un-registered version software, on-screen messages are displayed, usually when the program is started, reminding users that they have an unregistered version of the program that they should pay for if they intend to continue using it. Some programs will also display the message at random intervals while the program is in use. 
GVN: Global value numbering	GVN: Global value numbering - Global value numbering (GVN) is a compiler optimization based on the SSA intermediate representation. It sometimes helps eliminate redundant code that common subexpression evaluation (CSE) does not. At the same time, however, CSE may eliminate code that GVN does not, so both are often found in modern compilers. Global value numbering is distinct from local value numbering in that the value-number mappings hold across basic block boundaries as well, and different algorithms are used to compute the mappings. 
GW Basic	GW Basic - GW-BASIC was a dialect of BASIC developed by Microsoft from BASICA, originally for Compaq. It is compatible with Microsoft/IBM BASICA, but was disk based and did not require the resources of the ROM included on IBM's machines. It was bundled with MS-DOS operating systems on IBM PC compatibles by Microsoft. Like other early microcomputer versions of BASIC, GW-BASIC lacked many of the structures needed for structured programming such as local variables, and GW-BASIC programs executed relatively slowly, due to the fact that it was an interpreted programming language. It did have a large number of graphics commands. 
Gzip: GNU zip	Gzip: GNU zip - GNU zip (gzip) is a GNU free software file compression program. It was created by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler. gzip is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. DEFLATE was intended as a replacement for LZW and other patent-encumbered data compression algorithms which, at the time, limited the usability of compress and other popular archivers. gzip is often also used to refer to the gzip file format.
Handwriting Recognition	Handwriting Recognition - Handwriting recognition refers to a computer receiving handwritten input and intelligently recognize it to some characters. The image of the written text may be sensed off line from a piece of paper by optical scanning (optical character recognition). Alternatively, the movements of the pen tip may be sensed on line, for example, by a pen-based computer screen surface. 
Haskell Programming Language	Haskell Programming Language - Haskell Programming Language, simply called Haskell in most cases, is a standardized pure functional programming language with non-strict semantics, named after the logician Haskell Curry. Haskell was designed by a committee from the functional programming community in April 1990. It features static polymorphic typing, higher-order functions, user-defined algebraic data types, and pattern-matching list comprehensions. Innovations include a class system, systematic operator overloading, a functional I/O system, functional arrays, and separate compilation. 
Helper Applications	Helper Applications - Helper application is an external viewer program launched to display content retrieved using a web browser. These applications commonly let you see and hear video and audio files, as well as view specialized text files or virtual reality models. Windows Media Player, QuickTime, Shockwave, CosmoPlayer, and RealAudio are examples of helper applications. Another common term for these programs is plug ins, because they supplement the capabilities of your browser, and only run when they are needed to display files. 
Heterogeneous System	Heterogeneous System - Heterogeneous systems, in software context, refer to systems that have different aspects such as the interface, the implementation, the data, etc. Two systems in a family are heterogeneous to the extent that they are incompatible in some way. One may represent information differently or not include certain functionality or adopt different security policies. If everything between two systems are the same and interoperate, they are homogeneous. Federating or integrating homogeneous systems is presumably simpler than federating heterogeneous systems. 
Hex editor	Hex editor - Hex editor is a tool used to create and modify binary files. 
High-Level Language	High-Level Language - High-level language, also known as high-level programming language, is a programming language that, in comparison to low-level programming languages, may be more abstract, easier to use, or more portable across platforms. Examples include languages such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. 
HLA: High Level Architecture	HLA: High Level Architecture - The High Level Architecture (HLA) is a general purpose architecture for distributed computer simulation systems. Using HLA, computer simulations can communicate to other computer simulations regardless of the computing platforms. Communication between simulations is managed by a runtime infrastructure (RTI). 
HLA: High Level Assembly	HLA: High Level Assembly - High Level Assembly (HLA) is an assembly language developed by Randall Hyde which can use high level language constructs to aid x86 assembly programmer beginners and advanced assembly developers alike. It fully supports advanced data types and object-oriented assembly language programming. It uses a syntax loosely based on several high-level languages, such as C/C++, Ada, Modula-2, and Pascal, to allow the creation of readable assembly language programs, and to allow High-level language (HLL) programmers to learn HLA as rapidly as possible. 
HMP: Hybrid Multiprocessing	HMP: Hybrid Multiprocessing - Hybrid multiprocessing(HMP) refers to a kind of multitasking which provides some elements of symmetric multiprocessing, using add-on IBM software called MP/2. IBM OS/2 supports HMP. 
Hoard Memory Allocator	Hoard Memory Allocator - The Hoard memory allocator, or Hoard, is a memory allocator for Linux, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Hoard can improve the performance of multithreaded applications by providing fast, scalable memory management functions (malloc and free). In particular, it reduces contention for the heap (the central data structure used in dynamic memory allocation) caused when multiple threads allocate or free memory, and avoids the false sharing that can be introduced by memory allocators. At the same time, Hoard has low fragmentation. 
Homogeneous System	Homogeneous System - Homogeneous systems, in software context, refer to the systems if they have the same aspects like the same interface, the same implementation, that can interoperate, can share data, etc. Otherwise, they are heterogeneous, which may represent information differently or not include certain functionality or adopt different security policies. Federating or integrating homogeneous systems is presumably simpler than federating heterogeneous systems. 
Horizontal Software	Horizontal Software - Horizontal software, also known as horizontal application, refers to the kind of software used by many different kinds of organizations, such as word processing or bookkeeping software. 
HotHTML	HotHTML - HotHTML is a HTML editor and text editor rolled into one with a strong focus on web development, originally released as a freeware web coding tool (WYSIWYN). 
HSQLDB	HSQLDB - HSQLDB is a relational database management system written in Java. It is based on Thomas Mueller's discontinued Hypersonic SQL Project. The software is available under a BSD license. HSQLDB has a JDBC driver and supports a rich subset of SQL-92, SQL-99, and SQL:2003 standards. It offers a fast, small database engine which offers both in-memory and disk-based tables. 
HTML Editor	HTML Editor - A HTML editor is an software application for creating web pages. Although the HTML markup of a web page can be written with any text editor, specialised HTML editors can offer convenience and added functionality. For example, many HTML editors can work not only with HTML, but also with related technologies such as CSS, XML and JavaScript or ECMAScript. 
HTML-Kit	HTML-Kit - HTML-Kit is an HTML editor for Microsoft Windows made by chami.com. It falls into the class of HTML editors that emphasize editing HTML code directly, although it does have built-in functionality for previewing code. 
Hydrogen Software	Hydrogen Software - Hydrogen software is an advanced drum machine application originally developed for GNU/Linux but later ported to Windows and Mac OS X. Its main goal is to bring professional yet simple and intuitive pattern-based drum programming. 
HyperCard	HyperCard - HyperCard was an application program from Apple Computer in 1987. It most closely resembles a database application in concept, in that it stores information, and is graphical, flexible and creates files that are easy to modify. It also includes HyperTalk to manipulate data and the user interface. HyperCard users often used it as a programming system for Rapid Application Development as opposed to a database. The HyperCard model consists of cards, and collections of cards, called stacks. You can connect the cards in various ways, and leaf through them the way you would with a set of Rolodex cards. In addition to data, each card can contain graphics and buttons that trigger other events, such as sound or video. 
Hypermedia	Hypermedia - Hypermedia, a logical extension of the term hypertext, allows graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks intertwine to create a generally non-linear medium of information. This contrasts with multimedia, which, although often capable of random access in terms of the physical medium, is essentially linear in nature. The World Wide Web is a classic example of hypermedia, whereas a movie on a DVD is an example of standard multimedia. The lines between the two can (and often do) blur depending on how a particular technological medium is implemented. 
HyperTalk	HyperTalk - HyperTalk is a high-level programming language created in 1987 by Dan Winkler and used in conjunction with Apple Computer's HyperCard hypermedia program. The main target audience of HyperTalk was beginning programmers, hence HyperTalk programmers were usually called authors, and the process of writing programs was called scripting. HyperTalk scripts are fairly similar to written English, and use a logic structure similar to the Pascal programming language.
IBALANCE	IBALANCE - iBALANCE is the specialized software that recieves the data from the various sensors and gyroscopes on the IBOT powered wheelchair mobility system, allowing the iBOT to maintain balance during certain maneuvers. for example during curb climbing the seat remains level while parts of the chassis tilt to climb the curb. 
IDE: Integrated Development Environment	IDE: Integrated Development Environment - Integrated development environment (IDE), also known as integrated design environment and integrated debugging environment, is a type of computer software that assists computer programmers to develop software. IDEs normally consist of a source code editor, a compiler and/or interpreter, build-automation tools, and (usually) a debugger. Sometimes a version control system and various tools to simplify the construction of a GUI are integrated as well. Many IDEs also integrate a class browser, an object inspector and a class hierarchy diagram, for use with object oriented software development. Although some multiple-language IDEs are in use, such as the Eclipse IDE, NetBeans or Microsoft Visual Studio, typically an IDE is devoted to a specific programming language, as in the Visual Basic IDE. 
I-DEAS: Integrated-Design Engineering Analysis Software	I-DEAS: Integrated-Design Engineering Analysis Software - Integrated-Design Engineering Analysis Software (I-DEAS) was a CAD/CAM software package of SDRC which was bought in 2002 by EDS and now merged into UGS's product NX (Unigraphics). I-DEAS also incorporates Finite Element Method solver for mechanical stress/strain, thermal analysis, and other FEM analysis techniques. 
IDMS: Integrated Database Management System	IDMS: Integrated Database Management System - Integrated Database Management System(IDMS) is a (network) CODASYL database management system first developed at B.F. Goodrich and later marketed by Cullinane Database Systems (renamed Cullinet in 1983). Since 1989 the product has been owned by Computer Associates, who renamed it CA-IDMS. 
IEEE 829-1998	IEEE 829-1998 - IEEE 829-1998, also known as the 829 Standard for Software Test Documentation, is an IEEE standard that specifies the form of a set of documents for use in eight defined stages of software testing, each stage potentially producing its own separate type of document. The standard specifies the format of these documents but does not stipulate whether they all must be produced, nor does it include any criteria regarding adequate content for these documents. 
IGS: Interactive Geometry Software	IGS: Interactive Geometry Software - Interactive geometry software (IGS) are computer programs which allow one to create and then manipulate geometric constructions, primary in plane geometry. One starts construction by putting a few points and using them to define new objects (lines, circles, other points, etc). After some construction is done, one can move the points one starts with and see how the construction changes. 
IIS: Internet Information Server	IIS: Internet Information Server - Internet Information Server (IIS), also known as Internet Information Service, is a Microsoft developed system that provides a set of Internet-based services for servers using Microsoft Windows. It is the world's second most popular web server in terms of overall websites behind the Apache HTTP Server although the gap is decreasing. IIS currently supports FTP, SMTP, NNTP and HTTP/HTTPS. 
IM: Identity Management	IM: Identity Management - Identity Management (IM) is an integrated system of business processes, policies and technologies that enable organizations to facilitate and control their users' access to critical online applications and resources while protecting confidential personal and business information from unauthorized users. 
ING: International Network of Crackers	ING: International Network of Crackers - International Network of Crackers (INC) was one of the premier cracking/releasing warez for the IBM PC during the very late 1980s and early 90s.The formation of INC was the result of the merger of several cracking groups, including Union, based out of Texas, and the Miami Cracking Machine (MCM), based out of Florida. 
Ingres	Ingres - Ingres is a commercially supported, open-source relational database management system. Ingres was first created as a research project at the University of California, Berkeley starting in the early 1970s and ending in the early 1980s. The original code, like that from other projects at Berkeley, was available at minimal cost under a version of the BSD license. Since the mid-1980s, Ingres had spawned a number of commercial database applications, including Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, NonStop SQL and a number of others. Ingres Corporation owns and provides support and services for Ingres, OpenROAD and the connectivity products. In February 2006, Ingres Corporation released Ingres 2006 under the GNU General Public Licence. 
INI File: Initialization File	INI File: Initialization File - An initialization file (INI file) is a configuration file that contains configuration data for Microsoft Windows based applications. Starting with Windows 95, the INI file format was superseded but not entirely replaced by a registry database in Microsoft operating systems. Although made popular by Windows, INI files can be used on any system thanks to their flexibility. They allow a program to store configuration data, which can then be easily parsed and changed. 
Inline Expansion	Inline Expansion - Inline expansion or inlining for short is a compiler optimization which expands a function call site into the actual implementation of the function which is called, rather than each call transferring control to a common piece of code. This reduces overhead associated with the function call, which is especially important for small and frequently called functions, and it helps call-site-specific compiler optimizations, especially constant propagation. The main drawback is that the expansion usually results in a larger binary code, which can actually hurt performance if it damages locality of reference or exceeds resource constraints. 
Instruction	Instruction - In computer technologies, instruction, also known as computer instruction, refers to a basic command at the level of computer's machine language. It is typically a single operation of a processor within a computer architecture. 
Instruction Scheduling	Instruction Scheduling - Instruction scheduling, in computer technologies, is a compiler optimization phase used to improve instruction-level parallelism, which improves performance on machines with instruction pipelines. Without changing the meaning of the instructions, instruction scheduling tries to: 1) avoid pipeline stalls by rearranging the order of instructions; 2) order the instructions to avoid duplicated memory access. 
Instruction Selection	Instruction Selection - Instruction selection is a compiler optimization that transforms an intermediate representation of a program into the final compiled code, either in binary or assembly format. It works by covering the intermediate representation with as few tiles as possible. 
Instruction Set	Instruction Set - An instruction set, also known as instruction set architecture (ISA), is the part of the computer architecture related to programming, including the native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external I/O. An ISA includes a specification of the set of opcodes (machine language), the native commands implemented by a particular CPU design. 
Insure++	Insure++ - Insure++ is a memory debugger computer program, used by software developers to detect various errors in programs written in C and C++. It is made by Parasoft, and is functionally similar to other memory debuggers, such as Purify and Valgrind. 
Integrated Software Package	Integrated Software Package - Integrated software package refers to a suite of software with several applications integrated into one package. For example, a software package such as Microsoft Office that contains word processing, spreadsheet, database, graphics and communications. They are designed so that the user can move easily from one application to another, and transfer data easily from one application to another within the software package. 
Integration Testing	Integration Testing - Integration testing, also known as system integration testing (SIT), is the phase of software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It follows unit testing and precedes system testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been checked out by unit testing, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an Integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing. The purpose of Integration testing is to verify functional, performance and reliability requirements placed on major design items. 
Intelligent Device Management	Intelligent Device Management - Intelligent Device Management is a term used for enterprise software applications that allow various equipment manufacturers to proactively monitor and manage remote equipment, systems and products via the Internet and provide instant and cost-effective service & support to their customers. 
IntelliJ IDEA	IntelliJ IDEA - IntelliJ IDEA is a commercial Java IDE by JetBrains company. It includes a set of integrated refactoring tools that allow programmers to quickly redesign their code. A number of its features accelerate development and allow programmers to concentrate on functionality while IntelliJ IDEA handles more mundane coding tasks. Among other features, IntelliJ IDEA provides close integration with popular open source development tools such as CVS, Subversion, Apache Ant and JUnit. 
Interchangeability	Interchangeability - In computer science, interchangeability is an ability that an object can be replaced by another object without affecting code using the object. That chance usually requires two objects share an interface that is either same strictly or compatible in particular case.
Interface	Interface - An interface, in computer programming, is a defined means for a system to communicate with other systems. It is a boundary between a system and its environment providing ways of providing the system inputs and receiving outputs. In Object Oriented programming, class definitions and method signatures provide interfaces. Application program interfaces (APIs) form the interface of a system to applications and often consist of collections of functions or commands in a scripting language. Interfaces may be hidden (available only to the system developer) or exposed (available to others). 
Interface Encapsulation	Interface Encapsulation - An interface encapsulates refers to an implementation in a system in which the system implementation can be changed without changing the interface. With the interface encapsulation property, the changes in the system will not effect its way to communicate with other systems. 
Interface Standard	Interface Standard - Interface standard refers to a standard in communications that defines one or more functional and/or physical characteristics necessary to allow the exchange of information between two or more systems or equipments. An interface standard may include operational specifications and acceptable levels of performance. 
Internal Command	Internal Command - Internal commands are executed by the command processor programs COMMAND.COM in DOS and CMD.EXE in OS/2. The command processor is always loaded when the operating system is loaded. In DOS and OS/2, a command, such as Copy, Dir and Rename, are internal commands which may be used at all times. 
Interpreter Program	Interpreter Program - An interpreter program is a computer program that executes an input program, while a compiler does not execute its input program (the source code) but only translates it into another language, usually executable machine code (also called object code) which is output to a file for later execution. People can execute the same source code either directly by an interpreter or by compiling it and then executing the machine code produced later. It takes longer to run a program under an interpreter than to run the compiled code but it can take less time to interpret it than the total time required to compile and run it. This is especially important when prototyping and testing code when an edit-interpret-debug cycle can often be much shorter than an edit-compile-run-debug cycle. 
Interprocedural Optimization	Interprocedural Optimization - Interprocedural optimization is an integral component in a compilation system to improve computing performance. The importance of interprocedural optimization stems from two sources: it increases the context available to the optimizing compiler, and it enables programmers to use procedure calls without the concern of hurting execution time. 
Inverse mapping	Inverse mapping - Inverse mapping is a procedure used to create associations between real or virtual objects that involves some type of reversal of another process or concept. Various types of inverse mapping are used in a wide range of mathematical applications. 
Iprism	Iprism - IPrism is an Internet filter distributed by St. Bernard Software. It can monitor, block, and report on inappropriate Internet access. 
IR: Information Retrieval	IR: Information Retrieval - Information retrieval (IR) is the science of searching for information in documents, searching for documents themselves, searching for metadata which describes documents, or searching within databases, whether relational stand-alone databases or hypertext networked databases such as the Internet or intranets, for text, sound, images or data. There is a common confusion, however, between data retrieval, document retrieval, information retrieval, and text retrieval, and each of these has their own bodies of literature, theory, praxis and technologies. 
IRC Bot: Internet Relay Chat Bot	IRC Bot: Internet Relay Chat Bot - Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot is a set of scripts or an independent program that connects to Internet Relay Chat as a client, and so appears to other IRC users as another user. It differs from a regular client in that instead of providing interactive access to IRC for a human user, it performs automated functions. Often, an IRC bot is deployed as a detached program running from a stable host. It sits on an IRC channel to keep it open and prevents malicious users from taking over the channel. It can be configured to give channel operator status to privileged users when they join the channel, and can provide a unified channel operator list. An IRC bot can also perform many other useful functions, such as logging what happens in an IRC channel, giving out information on demand (very popular in IRC channels dealing with user support), creating statistics, hosting trivia games, and so on. 
ISA: Instruction Set Architecture	ISA: Instruction Set Architecture - Instruction set architecture, also known as instruction set, is the part of the computer architecture related to programming, including the native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external I/O. An ISA includes a specification of the set of opcodes (machine language), the native commands implemented by a particular CPU design. 
IT Management: Information Technology Management	IT Management: Information Technology Management - Information technology management (IT management), also called Management of Information Systems (MIS), is a combination of two branches: information technology and management. One implies the management of a collection of systems, infrastructure, and information that resides in them. Another implies the management of information technologies as a business function. This aims at achieving the goals and objectives of an organisation through computers. 
IT: Information Technology	IT: Information Technology - Information Technology (IT) is a broad subject concerned with technology and other aspects of managing and processing information, especially in large organizations. In particular, IT deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit, and retrieve information. For that reason, computer professionals are often called IT specialists or Business Process Consultants, and the division of a company or university that deals with software technology is often called the IT department. Other names for the latter are information services (IS) or management information services (MIS), managed service providers (MSP). 
ITS: Incompatible Time-Sharing System	ITS: Incompatible Time-Sharing System - Incompatible time-sharing System(ITS) is operating system written for the DEC PDP-6 and PDP-10 at MIT and long used at the MIT AI Lab. ITS pioneered many important innovations, including transparent file sharing between machines and terminal-independent I/O. After about 1982, most actual work was shifted to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker community. 
IZArc	IZArc - IZArc is a freeware file archiver for Microsoft Windows. It handles a great variety of archive formats, including some of the commonly used ones like zip, rar, gzip, bzip2, and 7z.One distinguishing feature of IZArc is the ability to convert an archive from one format to another format.
J2EE: Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition	J2EE: Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition - Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), now called Java Platform, Enterprise Editor(Java EE), is a programming platform part of the Java Platform for developing and running distributed multitier architecture Java applications, based largely on modular software components running on an application server. The Java EE platform is defined by a specification. Similar to other Java Community Process specifications, Java EE is also considered informally to be a standard because providers must agree to certain conformance requirements in order to declare their products as Java EE compliant; albeit with no ISO or ECMA standard. 
JACK Audio Connection Kit	JACK Audio Connection Kit - The JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK) is a soundserver or daemon that provides low latency connections between so-called jackified applications. It is created by Paul Davis and others and licensed under the GPL. JACK is free audio software. It can use ALSA, PortAudio and (still experimental) OSS as its back-end. As of 2003 it runs on GNU / Linux and Mac OS X. 
JADE Programming Language	JADE Programming Language - JADE is an object-oriented programming language that exhibits a seamlessly integrated object-oriented database management system. It is designed to be an end-to-end development environment, which allows systems to be coded in one language from the database server at one end down to the clients at the other. 
Jakarta Project	Jakarta Project - The Jakarta Project creates and maintains open source software for the Java platform. It operates as an umbrella project under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation, and all of Jakarta products are released under the Apache License. 
Java	Java - Java, in computer programming, is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It resembles C++, but was designed to avoid some of C++'s most notorious flaws. The Java language is used extensively on the World Wide Web, particularly because of its cross-platform nature, and its sandbox security concept. 
Java Beans	Java Beans - Java bean, in computer programming, is a portable, platform-independent means of creating reusable components. Created by Sun Microsystems, Java Beans is intended to be similar in functionality to OpenDOC, ActiveX, OLE, and COM. 
Java Bytecode	Java Bytecode - Java bytecode is the form of instructions that the Java virtual machine executes. Each bytecode instruction is one byte in length (hence the name), thus the number of bytecodes is limited to no more than 256. Not all 256 possible bytecode values are used, in fact Sun Microsystems, the original creators of the Java programming language, the Java virtual machine and other components of the Java Runtime Environment, have set aside a number of values to be permanently unimplemented. A Java programmer does not need to be aware of or understand Java bytecode at all. However, Understanding bytecode and what bytecode is likely to be generated by a Java compiler helps the Java programmer in the same way that knowledge of assembler helps the C or C++ programmer. 
Java EE: Java Platform, Enterprise Edition	Java EE: Java Platform, Enterprise Edition - Java Platform, Enterprise Editor(Java EE), formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), is a programming platform part of the Java Platform for developing and running distributed multitier architecture Java applications, based largely on modular software components running on an application server. The Java EE platform is defined by a specification. Similar to other Java Community Process specifications, Java EE is also considered informally to be a standard because providers must agree to certain conformance requirements in order to declare their products as Java EE compliant; albeit with no ISO or ECMA standard. 
Java Programming Language	Java Programming Language - Java programming language, simply called Java in most cases, is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems 1995. Java borrows much syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. Unlike conventional languages which are generally designed to be compiled to native code, Java is compiled to a bytecode which is then run (generally using JIT compilation) by a Java virtual machine. Java has been adopted as a multipurpose, cross-platform lingua franca for network computing, including the World Wide Web.

Jump Threading	Jump Threading - In computing, jump threading is a compiler optimization. In this pass, conditional jumps in the code that branch to identical or inverse tests are detected, and can be threaded through a second conditional test. This is easily done in a single pass through the program, following acyclic chained jumps until you arrive at a fixed point. 
JVM: Java Virtual Machine	JVM: Java Virtual Machine - A Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a crucial component of the Java Platform originally developed by Sun Microsystems, is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. This code is most often generated by Java language compilers, although the JVM has also been targeted by compilers of other languages. The availability of JVMs on many types of hardware and software platforms enables Java to function both as middleware and a platform in its own right. Different computers require different JVMs but they should run the same Java code. This means that servers only need to provide one version of each applet, instead of different 'native code' versions for PCs, Apple Macintoshes, and UNIX workstations, as is the case with other plug-ins.

Legacy System	Legacy System - A legacy system is an antiquated existing computer system or application program which continues to be used because the user does not want to replace or redesign it. Legacy systems are considered to be potentially problematic for several reasons. Legacy systems often run on obsolete (and usually slow) hardware, and sometimes spare parts for such computers become increasingly difficult to obtain. These systems are often hard to maintain, improve, and expand because there is a general lack of understanding of the system. The designers of the system may have left the organization, leaving no one left to explain how it works. Such a lack of understanding can be exacerbated by inadequate documentation or manuals getting lost over the years. Integration with newer systems may also be difficult because new software may use completely different technologies. 
LGPL: Lesser General Public License	LGPL: Lesser General Public License - The GNU Lesser General Public License(GLGPL or LGPL), formerly the GNU Library General Public License, is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation. It was designed as a compromise between the strong-copyleft GNU General Public License and simple permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License. The GNU Lesser General Public License was written in 1991 (and updated in 1999) by Richard Stallman, with legal advice from Eben Moglen. The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter can be linked to (in the case of a library, 'used by') a non-(L)GPLed program, which may be free software or proprietary software. This non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any chosen terms, provided that the terms allow modification for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. 
LHA	LHA - LHA, originally named LHarc, is a freeware compression utility and associated file format, created by Haruyasu Yoshizaki. Although no longer much used in the West, LHA remains popular in Japan. It was used by id Software to compress installation files for their earlier games, such as Doom.

Uniquely, it is designed to be recompilable across different CPU's. 
Lint Programming Tool	Lint Programming Tool - Lint Programming Tool refers to a type of tools that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language. The term lint-like behavior is sometimes applied to the process of flagging suspicious language usage. Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis of source code. Lint tool can be used to check C and C++ programs for error-prone syntactical constructs. The C and C++ language standards are loosely written. Plenty of run-time details, such as the actual size of an int, are left up to compiler implementers. Lint can help programmer find dangerous and nonportable constructs in the code before a compiler turns them into run-time bugs. 
Linux	Linux - Linux, also known as GNU/Linux, is a free and open source Unix-like computer operating system. Unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows or Mac OS, all of Linux underlying source code is available to the general public for anyone to use, modify, and redistribute freely. Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market. It is used in systems ranging from supercomputers to mobile phones.

An LIS is a highly configurable application which is customized to facilitate a wide variety of laboratory workflow models. Deciding on an LIS vendor is a major undertaking for all but the smallest labs. ; 
LISP Programming Language	LISP Programming Language - Lisp programming language (LISP), originally specified in 1958, is the second-oldest (only Fortran is older) high-level programming language in widespread use. LISP has changed a great deal since its early days, and a number of dialects have existed over its history. Today, the most widely-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme. Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, based on Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, object-oriented programming, and the self-hosting compiler.

Most LMS systems are web-based to facilitate anytime, anywhere access to learning content and administration. At a minimum, the LMS usually allows for student registration, the delivery and tracking of e-learning courses and content, and testing, and may also allow for the management of instructor-led training classes. In the most comprehensive of LMSs, one may find tools such as competency management, skills-gap analysis, succession planning, certifications, virtual live classes, and resource allocation (venues, rooms, textbooks, instructors, etc.). Most systems allow for learners self-service, facilitating self-enrollment, and access to courses. 
LNO: Loop Nest Optimization	LNO: Loop Nest Optimization - Loop nest optimization (LNO) is a special case of loop transformation which deals with nested loops that makes possible large reductions in the cache bandwidth necessary for some pervasive algorithms. 
Loader Program	Loader Program - Loader program is an operating system utility that performs the functions of a linker program and then immediately schedules the resulting executable program for action in the form of a memory image, without necessarily saving the program as an executable file. Loader programs are useful for prototyping, testing, and one-off applications. ; 
Locator Program	Locator Program - Locator program is a type of a software development tool that assigns physical addresses to a relocatable program. This is the last step in preparing software for execution by an embedded system. The resulting file is called an executable. In some cases, the locator's functionality is built into the linker or loader, which performs the location step. 
Logic Programming	Logic Programming - Logic programming (sometimes called logical programming) is programming that makes use of pattern-directed invocation of procedures from assertions and goals. The first logic programming language was Planner which featured pattern-directed invocation of procedural plans from both assertions and goals. In order to cope with the very limited memory systems that were available when it was developed, Planner used backtracking control structure so that only one possible computation path had to be stored at a time. Subsequently, Prolog was developed as a simplification of Planner that had pattern-directed invocation only from goals (also based on backtracking). From Planner there developed the programming languages QA-4, Popler, Conniver, and QLISP. The programming languages Mercury, Visual Prolog, Oz and Fril developed from Prolog. There are also concurrent logic programming languages (not based on backtracking) derived from Planner (e.g., Ether) and derived from Prolog. 
Loop Fission	Loop Fission - Loop fission is a compiler optimization technique attempting to break a loop into multiple loops over the same index range but each taking only a part of the loop's body. The goal is to break down large loop body into smaller ones to achieve better data locality. It is the reverse action to loop fusion. 
Loop Fusion	Loop Fusion - Loop fusion is a technique for compiler optimization and loop transformation, which replaces multiple loops with a single one. It is the reverse action to loop fission. 
Loop Interchange	Loop Interchange - Loop interchange, a compiler optimization technique, is the process of exchanging the order of two iteration variables. One major purpose of loop interchange is to improve the cache performance for accessing array elements. Cache misses occur if the contiguously accessed array elements within the loop come from a different cache line. Loop interchange can help prevent this. The effectiveness of loop interchange depends on and must be considered in light of the cache model used by the underlying hardware and the array model used by the compiler. 
Loop Inversion	Loop Inversion - Loop inversion is a technique in compiler optimization, particularly in loop transformation. This technique changes a standard while loop into a do/while (a.k.a. repeat/until) loop wrapped in an if conditional, reducing the number of jumps by two, for cases when the loop is executed. Doing so duplicates the condition check (increasing the size of the code) but is more efficient because jumps usually cause a pipeline stall. Additionally, if the initial condition is known at compile-time and is known to be side-effect-free, the if guard can be skipped. 
Loop Optimization	Loop Optimization - Loop optimization refers to the process in computer compiling to optimize loops in the programs. Most execution time of a scientific program is spent on loops. Thus a lot of compiler analysis and optimization techniques have been developed to make the execution of loops faster. 
Loop Splitting	Loop Splitting - Loop splitting, also known as loop peeling, is a compiler optimization technique. It attempts to simplify a loop or eliminate dependencies by breaking it into multiple loops which have the same bodies but iterate over different contiguous portions of the index range. 
Loop Tiling	Loop Tiling - Loop tiling, also known as loop blocking, is a loop optimization used by compilers to make the execution of certain types of loops more efficient. Loop tiling partitions a loop's iteration space into smaller chunks or blocks, so as to help ensure that data used in a loop stays in the cache until it is reused. The partitioning of loop iteration space leads to partitioning of large array into smaller blocks, thus fitting accessed array elements into cache size, enhancing cache reuse and eliminating cache size requirements. 
Loop Transformation	Loop Transformation - Loop transformation refers to a group of loop optimization techniques in computer programming and compiling, which plays an important role in improving cache performance and effective use of parallel processing capabilities. Common loop transformations include: - loop interchange - loop splitting/Loop peeling - loop fusion - loop fission - loop unrolling - loop tiling/loop blocking - loop skewing - loop inversion - loop-invariant code motion - vectorization - parallelization 
Loop Unswitching	Loop Unswitching - Loop unswitching is a compiler optimization technique. It moves a conditional inside a loop outside of it by duplicating the loop's body, and placing a version of it inside each of the if and else clauses of the conditional. This can improve the parallization of the loop. Since modern processors can operate fast on vectors this increases the speed. 
Loop Unwinding	Loop Unwinding - Loop unwinding, also known as loop unrolling, is a technique for optimizing parts of computer programs. The idea is to save time by reducing the number of overhead instructions that the computer has to execute in a loop, and thus improving the cache hit rate and reducing branching. To achieve this, the instructions that are called in multiple iterations of the loop are combined into a single iteration. This will speed up the program if the overhead instructions of the loop impair performance significantly. 
Loop-Invariant Code Motion	Loop-Invariant Code Motion - Loop-invariant code motion is a compiler optimization technique which performs loop-invariant code movement automatically to improve execution speed. Loop-invariant code in an imperative programming language consists of statements which could be moved to before the loop (if the loop always terminates), or after the loop, without affecting the semantics of the program. As a result, it is executed less often. 
Low-Level Language	Low-Level Language - Low-level programming language is a type of computer language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's microprocessor. The word low refers to the small or nonexistent amount of abstraction between the language and machine language, it is therefore often described as machine-oriented languages. They cannot easily be converted to run on a computer with a different central processing unit, and they are relatively difficult to learn because a detailed knowledge of the internal working of the computer is required. Since they must be translated into machine code by an assembler program, low-level languages are also called assembly languages. High-level and low-level are also used relatively, so a Java programmer might consider C to be a comparatively low-level language.; 
LSM: Linux Software Map	LSM: Linux Software Map - Linux Software Map (LSM) is a standard text format for describing Linux software. LSM for a program is a single text document, named software_package_name.lsm. An LSM begins with Begin4 and ends with End. It has one field on each line. Field name is separated from value by a : . Mandatory fields are Title, Version, Entered-date, Description, Author and Primary-site. 
LURCH	LURCH - LURCH is a software design debugging tool that uses a nondeterministic algorithm to quickly explore the reachable states of a software model. By performing a partial and random search, LURCH looks for faults in the model and reports the pathways leading to the faults. 
LWP: Light-Weight Process	LWP: Light-Weight Process - In computer operating systems, a light-weight process (LWP), confusingly known as a kernel thread, is a means of achieving multitasking. In contrast to a user thread, which is handled at the application level, a light-weight process is scheduled by the kernel. For this reason, they are generally preferred over a userland thread implementation whenever possible, as there is usually much less overhead. LWP is a single-threaded sub-process which, unlike a thread, has its own process identifier and may also differ in its inheritance and controlling features. ; 
LZO: Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer	LZO: Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer - Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer (LZO) is a data compression algorithm that is focused on decompression speed. The algorithm is lossless and the source is thread safe. A free software tool which implements the LZO algorithm is lzop. The original library was written in ANSI C, and it has been made available under the GNU General Public License. Versions of LZO are available for the Perl, Python and Java languages.

Mac OS: Macintosh Operating System	Mac OS: Macintosh Operating System - Macintosh operating system (Mac OS). is a series of graphical user interface-based operating systems developed by Apple Computer for their Macintosh line of computer systems. It was first introduced in 1984 with the original Macintosh 128K. Earlier versions of the Mac OS were compatible only with Motorola 68000-based Macintoshes, while later versions were also compatible with the PowerPC (PPC) architecture. Most recently, Mac OS X has become compatible with Intel's PC CPU architecture. 
Machine Code	Machine Code - Machine code, also known as machine language, is a system of instructions and data directly understandable by computer central processing unit. Every CPU model has its own machine code, or instruction set, although there is considerable overlap between some. If CPU A understands the full language of CPU B it is said that CPU A is compatible with B. CPU B may not be compatible with CPU A, as A may know a few codes that B does not. 
Machine Code Instruction	Machine Code Instruction - Machine code instruction are the words of a machine or a computer. Instructions are patterns of bits with different patterns corresponding to different commands to the machine. Every CPU model has its own machine code, or instruction set, although there is considerable overlap between some. 
Machine Language	Machine Language - Machine language, also known as machine code, is the lowest-level language (except for computers that utilize programmable microcode) directly understandable by a computer central processing unit (CPU). While easily understood by computers, machine languages are very hard to understand for humans because they consist entirely of numbers. Programmers, therefore, use either a high-level programming language or an assembly language. An assembly language contains the same instructions as a machine language, but the instructions and variables have names instead of being just numbers. 
Macro	Macro - A macro in computer science is an abstraction, that defines how a certain input pattern is replaced by an output pattern according to a defined set of rules. There are three broad categories of macros, and each takes a different kind of input pattern to produce a different kind of output pattern: Programming macros, Application Macros and Keyboard macros. 
Macro Language	Macro Language - A macro language is a programming language in which all or most computation is done by expanding macros. Macro languages are not widely used for general-purpose programming, but are common in text processing applications, for example, C preprocessor and Internet Macros (iOpus). 
Macro-instruction	Macro-instruction - Macro-instruction is an instruction that defines a macro. In assembly language, MACRO and ENDM are examples that define the beginning and end of a macro. In C, the #DEFINE statement is used. 
Macromedia Flash	Macromedia Flash - Macromedia Flash, or simply Flash, refers to both a multimedia authoring program and the Flash Player, written and distributed by Macromedia (now part of Adobe Systems). Flash utilizes vector and raster graphics, a native scripting language called ActionScript and bidirectional streaming of video and audio.

It can also automate many tasks such as web indexing for static pages. Mambo can provide RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, forums, polls, calendars, website searching, language internationalization, and other possibilities. 
MASM: Microsoft Macro Assembler	MASM: Microsoft Macro Assembler - The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is an assembler for the x86 family of microprocessors, originally produced Microsoft MS-DOS operating system. It supported a wide variety of macro facilities and structured programming idioms, including high-level constructions for looping, procedure calls and alternation (therefore, MASM is an example of a high-level assembler). Later versions added the capability of producing programs for the Windows operating systems that were released to follow on from MS-DOS. MASM is one of the few Microsoft development tools for which there was no separate 16-bit and 32-bit versions. 
MCAD: Microsoft Certified Application Developer	MCAD: Microsoft Certified Application Developer - The Microsoft Certified Application Developer (MCAD) certification is the entry-level programming certification. The curriculum covers many topics related to the Microsoft .NET development platform.

To attain these certifications, a candidate must pass a series of exams within the program. Popular certifications are MCP, Microsoft Certified System Engineer (MCSE) and Microsoft Certified Database Administrator (MCDBA). 
MCSA: Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator	MCSA: Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator - Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator (MCSA) certification certifies a user's knowledge in system administration of Microsoft Windows operating systems and is generally simpler than, but not a subset of, the MCSE. The Windows Server 2003 MCSA is achieved upon passing 2 networking system exams, a client operating system exam (generally Microsoft Windows XP), and an elective exam. The Windows Server 2000 MCSA title is granted after taking 3 core exams and one elective. Although the MCSA isn't a subset of the MCSE, it is possible to gain an MCSA on the way to an MCSE without doing any exams that are extraneous to the MCSE on Windows 2000. 
MCSD: Microsoft Certified Solution Developer	MCSD: Microsoft Certified Solution Developer - Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MCSD) certification is the highest level programming certification offered by Microsoft. To fulfill the requirements of the certification, a total of five exams (four core exams, one elective exam) must be passed. Some of the core exams are also requirements for the MCAD. Microsoft has declared that this certification will be focused towards the needs of developers using .NET Framework 1.0 and 1.1 versions. Developers using .NET Framework 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 are expected to consider obtaining Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS) and Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD) certifications. 
MCSE: Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer	MCSE: Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer - Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) qualifies an individual of being able to analyze the business requirements for business solutions and design and implement the infrastructure required. As of 2006, the MCSE is available for two different products, Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003, each requiring a different set of exams. For the MCSE 2003, candidates must pass six Core exams design exams (Four networking exams, one client operating system and one design exam) and one elective exam, for a total of seven exams.

MDX: Multidimensional Expressions	MDX: Multidimensional Expressions - Multi-dimensional Expressions (MDX) is a query language for OLAP databases, which much like SQL is a query language for relational databases. It is also a calculation language, with syntax similar to spreadsheet formulas. MDX was first introduced as part of the OLEDB for OLAP specification in 1997 from Microsoft. The specification was quickly followed by the commercial release of Microsoft OLAP Services 7.0 in 1998, and later by Microsoft Analysis Services. While it was not an open standard, but rather a Microsoft-owned specification, it was adopted by a wide range of OLAP vendors. 
Media Cleaner Pro	Media Cleaner Pro - Media Cleaner Pro is a piece of software used to convert and optimize video and audio files for the Internet, DVD, CD-ROM, PowerPoint presentations, and other digital imagery. 
Memory Management	Memory Management - Memory management is a technique used by the Mac OS to optimize the use of memory. The original problem for the designers of the Macintosh was how to make optimum use of the 128 kB of RAM that the machine was equipped with. Since at that time the machine could only run one application program at a time, and there was no permanent secondary storage, the designers implemented a simple scheme which worked well with those particular constraints. However, that design choice did not scale well with the development of the machine, creating various difficulties for both programmers and users. This technique is one of the key areas addressed by the change to Mac OS X. 
Memwatch	Memwatch - Memwatch is a free programming tool for memory leak detection in C. It is highly portable ANSI C code which will run on just about any hardware that has a C compiler. While it is primarily intended to detect and diagnose memory leaks, it can also be used to analyze a programs memory usage and provides logging facilities. 
Metadata	Metadata - Metadata is data that describe other data. Metadata refers to information about data itself -- perhaps the origin, size, formatting or other characteristics of a data item. Metadata is of special interest in various fields of computer science, e. g. information retrieval and the semantic web. In the database field, metadata is essential to understanding and interpreting the contents of a data warehouse. Meta tags, a type of metadata, are optional elements defined in the header portion of an HTML or PHP file for web pages. 
MicroBSD	MicroBSD - MicroBSD is a fork of the UNIX-like BSD operating system descendant OpenBSD 3.0, begun in July 2002. The project's objective to produce a fully secure, complete system, but with a small footprint. The first phase of its development was aborted, but it has been resumed by a new group of developers. 
Microcode	Microcode - Microcode, also known as microprogram, refers to the instruction set of a CPU as a sequence of microcode instructions (microinstructions), each of which typically consists of a number of bit fields and the address of the next microinstruction to execute. Microcode is the translation layer between machine instructions and the elementary operations of a computer. Microcode is stored in ROM and allows the addition of new machine instructions without requiring that they be designed into electronic circuits when new instructions are needed. Several microinstructions will usually be required to fetch, decode and execute each machine code instruction. The elements composing the microprogram/microcode exist on a lower conceptual level than the more familiar assembler instructions. Each element is differentiated by the micro prefix to avoid confusion: microprogram, microcode, microinstruction, microassembler, etc. 
Microinstruction: Micro code Instruction	Microinstruction: Micro code Instruction - Microcode Instructions (microinstructions) are very basic low-level instructions in a computer CPU, which are used to manipulate bit streams and byte ordering. Microinstructions can control data flow and instruction-execution sequencing in a processor at a more fundamental level than machine instructions. Typically, a series of microinstructions is necessary to perform an individual machine instruction. 
Microkernel	Microkernel - A microkernel is a minimal computer operating system kernel providing only basic operating system services (system calls), while other services are provided by user-space programs called servers. Commonly, microkernels provide services such as address space management, thread management, and inter-process communication, but not networking or display for example. 
Micro-programming	Micro-programming - Micro-programming, also known as micro-coding, refers to the development of micro-programs or micro-codes, which are the instruction set of a CPU as a sequence of micro-code instructions (micro-instructions). Micro-programming allows CPU design engineers to write a micro-program to implement a machine instruction set. Even in the late stage of design process, micro-code could easily be changed. This greatly facilitated CPU design and led to more complex instruction sets. Architectures using micro-programming included the IBM System/360 and DEC VAX, the instruction sets of which were implemented by complex microprograms. The approach of using increasingly complex micro-code-implemented instruction sets was later called CISC. 
Microsoft .Net	Microsoft .Net - Microsoft .Net is an umbrella term that applies to a collection of products and technologies from Microsoft. All have in common a dependence on the Microsoft .NET Framework, a component of the Windows operating system. 
Microsoft .Net Framework	Microsoft .Net Framework - The Microsoft .NET Framework is a software component which can be added to the Microsoft Windows operating system. It provides a large body of pre-coded solutions to common program requirements, and manages the execution of programs written specifically for the framework. The .NET Framework is a key Microsoft offering, and is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform. 
Microsoft Access	Microsoft Access - Microsoft Access is a relational database management system from Microsoft, packaged with Microsoft Office Professional which combines the Jet relational database engine with a graphical interface. The development environment provides productivity-enhancing features for both advanced developers and beginning users. It can use data stored in Access/Jet, SQL Server, Oracle, or any ODBC-compliant data container. 
Microsoft SQL Server	Microsoft SQL Server - Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system produced by Microsoft.

MinGW Developer Studio	MinGW Developer Studio - MinGW Developer Studio is a freeware IDE (integrated development environment) for programming with C and its derivative, C++. MinGW Developer Studio is bundled with the open source GCC compiler, MinGW and the wxWidgets GUI library, offering a complete solution for both console and GUI programming with C/C++. The interfaces and functionalities are almost identical to Visual C++ 6.0, with added features such as code folding. 
MinGW: Minimalist GNU for Windows	MinGW: Minimalist GNU for Windows - Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW or Mingw32) is a software port of the GNU toolchain to the Win32 platform. It was originally a fork of Cygwin. Unlike Cygwin it does not require a compatibility layer DLL nor does its license require that applications developed with it are released under the GPL. 
Minix	Minix - MINIX is an open source, Unix-like operating system based on a microkernel architecture. Andrew S. Tanenbaum wrote the operating system to be used for educational purposes. Early Linux kernel development was done on a MINIX host system, which led to Linux inheriting various features from MINIX, such as the MINIX disk filesystem format. 
MIS: Management Information systems	MIS: Management Information systems - Management Information systems(MIS), also known as information technology management, generally refers to the application of information technology to business problems. In academic field, the study of information systems is usually a commerce and business administration discipline, and frequently involves software engineering, but also distinguishes itself by concentrating on the integration of computer systems with the aims of the organization. The area of study should not be confused with computer science which is more theoretical in nature and deals mainly with software creation, and not with computer engineering, which focuses more on the design of computer hardware. Very often, companies have a MIS department to take care of daily management and administration of the company's information infrastructure. 
MISRA C	MISRA C - MISRA C is a set of coding guidelines for the programming language C and later for C++ with extensions. The C guidelines are intended to be applied during the development of software used in safety-critical applications. Although written for use by the automotive industry, the problems addressed by the guidelines also occur in software produced for other industries and some development groups in these industries (e.g., medical device manufacturers) have adopted the MISRA C guidelines. 
MISRA: Motor Industry Software Reliability Association	MISRA: Motor Industry Software Reliability Association - Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA), is a collaboration between vehicle manufacturers, component suppliers and engineering consultants which seek to promote best practice in developing safety-related electronic systems in road vehicles. MISRA has developed a set of coding guidelines, called MISRA C, for the programming language C and then for C++. 
MIT License: Massachusetts Institute of Technology License	MIT License: Massachusetts Institute of Technology License - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) License, originated at the MIT, is a type of licence for the use of certain types of computer software. It allows reuse for open source and proprietary software. Many groups use the MIT license for their own software, such as expat, MetaKit, and the X Window System. 
Module	Module - In computer software programming, a module is a software entity that groups a set of (typically cohesive) subprograms/routines and data structures. Modules are units that can be compiled separately, which makes them reusable and allows multiple programmers to work on different modules simultaneously. Modules also promote modularity and encapsulation (i.e. information hiding), both of which can make complex programs easier to understand. Programs are composed of one or more independently developed modules that are not combined until the program is linked. 
Monad	Monad - Monad, Latin for unit, is a technique from category theory which has been adopted as a way of dealing with state in functional programming languages, which make use of monads to structure programs which include operations that must be executed in a specific order. The primary uses of monads in functional programming are to express input/output operations and changes in state without using language features that introduce side effects. A monad has three components: a means of augmenting an existing type, a means of creating a default value of this new type from a value of the original type, and a replacement for the basic application operator for the old type that works with the new type. 
Monotone	Monotone - Monotone is an open source software tool for revision control. Monotone tracks revisions to files, groups sets of revisions into changesets, and tracks history across renames. The design principle is distributed operation making heavy use of cryptographic primitives to track file revisions (via the SHA1 secure hash) and to authenticate user actions (via RSA cryptographic signatures). Each participant maintains their own revision history store in a local SQLite database. Monotone is especially strong in its support of a diverge/merge workflow, which it achieves in part by always allowing commit before merge. 
Moodle	Moodle - Moodle is an open source e-learning platform with a course management system (CMS). Such e-learning systems are sometimes also called Learning Management Systems (LMS), Virtual Learning Environments (VLE), education via computer-mediated communication (CMC) or Online Education. 
MOS: Microsoft Office Specialist	MOS: Microsoft Office Specialist - Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS), previously named Microsoft Office User Specialist (MOUS) is a certification for using the Microsoft Office suite of business applications. While listed under the MCP Certification Programs, it is not officially an MCP Certification. The MOS exams are managed by a third party company, Certiport. 
Mosaic	Mosaic - Mosaic is a World Wide Web browser and Gopher client developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) beginning in 1992, and officially ending on January 7, 1997. NCSA Mosaic was originally designed and programmed for Unix's X Window System. Marc Andreessen, the leader of the team that developed Mosaic, left NCSA and, with four other former students and staff of the University of Illinois, started Mosaic Communications Corporation. Mosaic Communications eventually became Netscape Communications Corporation, producing Netscape Navigator. Spyglass licensed the technology and trademarks from NCSA for producing their own web browser but never used any of the NCSA Mosaic source code. Spyglass Mosaic was later licensed by Microsoft, and it was modified and renamed to Internet Explorer. 
Moto Programming Language	Moto Programming Language - Moto Programming Language(Moto) is an Open Source server-side language much like PHP or JSP, developed by David Hakim. The primary difference between Moto and server-side scripting languages is that Moto pages can run interpreted (like PHP) or be natively compiled into dynamically loadable Apache modules. Moto has a type checking phase so programmers see more errors up front. Programmers can define classes and functions in Moto and make use of powerful exception handling. Moto comes with a full suite of objects and functions for state and session management, MySQL and PostgreSQL database connectivity, and a slew of utility classes. There is also an included interface definition language for exposing C functions to Moto. All object allocation occurs in a shared memory segment, so maintaining objects in memory between page views is a snap. 
MOV: Merchant of Venice	MOV: Merchant of Venice - Merchant of Venice (MOV), in computer programming, is a stock market trading and technic analysis program to manage graphs and portfolios. It has an internal language which supports all the most important econometric functions (RSI, Bollinger Bands, Momentum, Moving Averages, ecc.). It supports artificial intelligence techniques (Genetic Programming, Genetic Algorithm, ...). 
Mozbot	Mozbot - Mozbot is an IRC bot written in the Perl programming language under the MPL license, originally authored by Ian Hickson. Mozbot has a modular design, allowing for extension modules to be incorporated at runtime. 
Mozilla	Mozilla - Historically, Mozilla had been used internally as a codename for the Netscape Navigator web browser from its beginning. It was a contraction of Mosaic killer. Mozilla is sometimes used to refer to the Mozilla Organization, a free software / open source software project that was founded in order to create the next-generation Internet suite for Netscape. On August 3, 2005, Mozilla Foundation announced the creation of Mozilla Corporation, a wholly-owned for-profit taxable subsidiary of Mozilla Foundation, that will focus on delivering Firefox and Thunderbird to end users. 
Mozilla Application Object Model (AOM)	Mozilla Application Object Model (AOM) - The Mozilla Application Object Model (AOM) is an application programming interface for manipulating the application using JavaScript. It is similar to Document Object Model, but instead of being document-centric, it is application-centric. For example, opening web services, saving files, etc. 
Mozilla Firefox	Mozilla Firefox - Mozilla Firefox, or simply known as Firefox, is a free, open source, cross-platform, graphical web browser developed by the Mozilla Corporation and hundreds of volunteers. Firefox includes an integrated pop-up blocker, tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, support for open standards, and an extension mechanism for adding functionality. Although other browsers have some of these features, Firefox became the first such browser to include them all and achieve wide adoption. 
Mozilla Public License	Mozilla Public License - The Mozilla Public License is an open source and free software license. Version 1.0 was developed by Mitchell Baker when she worked as a lawyer at Netscape Communications Corporation and version 1.1 at the Mozilla Foundation. 
Mp3splt	Mp3splt - Mp3splt is a free(GNU GPL) digital audio splitter that runs on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The graphical user interface for the splitter is called mp3splt-gtk and is made with gtk2. The mp3splt project has also a library created from mp3splt, called libmp3splt and a graphical user interface called mp3splt-gtk that uses that library. 
Mp3splt-gtk	Mp3splt-gtk - Mp3splt-gtk is the GUI of Mp3splt, a free(GNU GPL) digital audio splitter that runs on GNU/Linux, and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The graphical user interface uses libmp3splt (based on mp3splt) and is made with GTK+ 2. 
MPS: Memory Pool System	MPS: Memory Pool System - The Memory Pool System (MPS) is a flexible and modular memory management system that was developed by Harlequin Inc. and now an open source software to support both their ScriptWorks PostScript RIP, and their Harlequin Dylan compiler and IDE for the Dylan programming language. As such it was designed to support a wide range of requirements from high-speed manual memory management, to complex garbage collection with many different types of reference. 
MS-DOS: MicroSoft Disk Operating System	MS-DOS: MicroSoft Disk Operating System - MicroSoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) is an operating system by Microsoft. It was the most widely used DOS for the PC compatible platform during the 1980s. It has gradually been replaced by the Windows operating system. MS-DOS is a single user operating system that runs one program at a time and is limited to working with one megabyte of memory, 640 kilobytes of which is usable for the application program. Special add-on EMS memory boards allow EMS-compliant software to exceed the 1Mbyte limit. Add-ons to DOS, such as Microsoft Windows and DESQview, take advantage of EMS and allow the user to have multiple applications loaded at once and switch between them. 
mSQL: Mini SQL	mSQL: Mini SQL - Mini SQL (mSQL) is a lightweight client/server database developed by Hughes Technologies in 1994. mSQL filled a gap that existed between the embedded desktop databases like Microsoft Access and the enterprise-level commercial databases such as Oracle and DB2. It was popular database of choice for open source developers in the middle of 90'. By 1996, development on mSQL began to stagnate and MySQL arose to fill that void. By 1999, MySQL had gone well beyond mSQL in popularity and today mSQL has less visibility. 
mSQL-JDBC	mSQL-JDBC - mSQL-JDBC is an Open Source Type IV Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver for the mSQL database engine created by George Reese. It is written in the Java programming language and uses the native mSQL network protocols to talk to mSQL. The driver supports as much of the JDBC specification as the mSQL database will support, but development on the driver basically ceased in 1997. The driver therefore does not support the most recent releases (3.0 and above) of mSQL. 
MSYS: Minimal SYStem	MSYS: Minimal SYStem - Minimal SYStem(MSYS), a part of MinGW, was created out of a long-lived desire to provide the MinGW community a Minimal SYStem, with which a configure script could be executed. MSYS provides POSIX/Bourne configure scripts the ability to execute and create a Makefile used by make. MSYS versions 1.0.8 and later include only the i386 binary distribution, which will run on any 32-bit Intel-compatible processor. 
MUI: Magic User Interface	MUI: Magic User Interface - The Magic User Interface(MUI) is an object oriented system by Stefan Stuntz to generate and maintain graphical user interfaces. The MUI was written for AmigaOS and gained popularity amongst both programmers and users. It has been ported to PowerPC processors and adopted as the default GUI toolkit of the MorphOS operating system. The MUI application programmer interface has been cloned by the Zune toolkit used in the Amiga Research Operating System. 
Multiple Perspective Software Development	Multiple Perspective Software Development - Multiple perspective software development refers to an approach to software development which requires communication and collaboration between experts in a number of different fields. 
Multiprocessing	Multiprocessing - Multiprocessing typically refers to the use of more than one processor (CPU) in a single computer system. So-called multiprocessor systems usually have a common memory space through which all of the processors can communicate and share data. Multiprocessing sometimes refers to the execution of multiple concurrent software processes in a system as opposed to a single process at any one instant. 
Multitasking	Multitasking - In computing, multitasking is technique used in an operating system for sharing a single processor between several independent jobs. In the case of a computer with a single CPU, only one task is said to be running at any point in time, meaning that the CPU is actively executing instructions for that task. Multitasking solves the problem by scheduling which task may be the one running at any given time, and when another waiting task gets a turn. The act of reassigning a CPU from one task to another one is called a context switch. When context switches occur frequently enough the illusion of parallelism is achieved. Even on computers with more than one CPU, multitasking allows many more tasks to be run than there are CPUs. 
Multithreading	Multithreading - Multithreading typically refers to sharing a single CPU between multiple tasks (or threads) in a way designed to minimise the time required to switch threads. This is accomplished by sharing as much as possible of the program execution environment between the different threads so that very little state needs to be saved and restored when changing thread. Multiple threads can be executed in parallel on many computer systems. This multithreading generally occurs by time slicing, wherein a single processor switches between different threads--in which case the processing is not literally simultaneous, for the single processor is only really doing one thing at a time. On a multiprocessor system, threading can be achieved via multiprocessing, wherein different threads can run simultaneously on different processors. 
MusE	MusE - MusE is a MIDI/Audio sequencer program with recording and editing capabilities written by Werner Schweer. MusE aims to be a complete multitrack virtual studio for Linux (it currently has no support under other platforms, due to its reliance on JACK and ALSA).

Nagware reminds or nags the user to register it by paying a fee. It usually does this by popping up a message when the user starts the program or, worse, intermittently while the user is using the application. These messages can appear as windows obscuring part of the screen or message boxes that can quickly be closed. 
Name Binding	Name Binding - In programming languages, name binding refers to the association of values with identifiers. An identifier bound to a value is said to reference that value. Since computers themselves have no notion of identifiers, there is no binding at the machine language level name binding is an abstraction provided by programming languages. Binding is intimately connected with scoping, as scope determines when binding occurs. 
Nanika	Nanika - Nanika is a desktop accessory application developed by Sagawa Toyoaki. Nanika is composed of three parts: 'materia', which is the basic foundation of Nanika system; 'shell', which can be described as a skin; 'ghost', which is a pseudo-AI engine. Nanika is heavily influenced by Japanese anime, such as Kanon and Ghost in the Shell.

Natural Language	Natural Language - Natural language refers to a language spoken or written by humans, as opposed to a language used to program or communicate with computers. Natural language understanding is one of the hardest problems of artificial intelligence due to the complexity, irregularity and diversity of human language and the philosophical problems of meaning. 
NetBSD	NetBSD - NetBSD is a freely redistributable, open source version of the Unix-like BSD computer operating system. It was the second open source BSD variant to be formally released, after 386BSD, and continues to be actively developed. Noted for its portability and quality of design and implementation, it is often used in embedded systems and as a starting point for the porting of other operating systems to new architectures. 
News Aggregator	News Aggregator - A news aggregator refers to a system including software application, webpage or service that collects syndicated content using RSS and other XML feeds from weblogs and mainstream media sites. Aggregators improve upon the time and effort needed to regularly check websites of interest for updates, creating a unique information space or personal newspaper. An aggregator is able to subscribe to a feed, check for new content at user-determined intervals, and retrieve the content. The content is sometimes described as being pulled to the subscriber, as opposed to pushed with email or other channels. Unlike recipients of some pushed information, the aggregator user can easily unsubscribe from a feed. 
NF: Normal Form	NF: Normal Form - Normal Forms (NFs) are the structures and algorithms to normalize a relational database. One can only describe a database as having a normal form if the relationships between quantities have been rigorously defined. It is possible to use set theory to express this knowledge once a problem domain has been fully understood, but most database designers model the relationships in terms of an idealized schema. 
NLP: Natural Language Processing	NLP: Natural Language Processing - Natural language processing(NLP) refers to the computer understanding, analysis, manipulation, and/or generation of natural language. NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence and linguistics. It studies the problems of automated generation and understanding of natural human languages.

Non-Printable Character	Non-Printable Character - Non-Printable Character is a character that doesn't have a corresponding character letter to its corresponding ASCII code. Examples would be the Linefeed, which is ASCII character code 10 decimal, the Carriage Return, which is 13 decimal, or the bell sound, which is decimal 7. On a PC, you can often add non-printable characters by holding down the Alt key, and typing in the decimal value. There are other character encoding schemes, but ASCII is the most prevalent. 
Non-Proprietary Software	Non-Proprietary Software - Non-proprietary software, the opposite of proprietary software, refers to the software that has no proprietary restrictions attached to it, particularly the restriction about the access to the source code. Proprietary software is software where the source code has not been made available, or it is protected by restrictive licensing clauses. Non-proprietary software is not a widely used term and has no generally accepted definition. It is sometimes used as an umbrella term for the many alternative terms for free software.
Nonrelocatable Block	Nonrelocatable Block - Nonrelocatable block is a block whose location in the heap is fixed. This block can't be moved during heap compaction or other memory operations. 
NonStop SQL	NonStop SQL - NonStop SQL is a relational database product originally produced at Tandem Computers using the pioneering Ingres source code from University of California, Berkeley.

It is available for Mac OS (under the name Graphing Calculator) and Microsoft Windows. 
Numerical Analysis	Numerical Analysis - Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms for the problems of continuous mathematics (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). Some of the problems it deals with arise directly from the study of calculus; other areas of interest are real variable or complex variable questions, numerical linear algebra over the real or complex fields, the solution of differential equations, and other related problems arising in the physical sciences and engineering.
OATH: Object-Oriented Abstract Type Hierarchy	OATH: Object-Oriented Abstract Type Hierarchy - Object-oriented Abstract Type Hierarchy (OATH) is a class library for C++ from Texas Instruments. 
Object	Object - Generally, Object refers to any item that can be individually selected and manipulated. In computer programming such as object-oriented programming, an object is an individual unit of run-time data storage that is used as the basic building block of programs. These objects act on each other, as opposed to a traditional view in which a program may be seen as a collection of functions, or simply as a list of instructions to the computer. Each object is capable of receiving messages, processing data, and sending messages to other objects. Each object can be viewed as an independent little machine or actor with a distinct role or responsibility. 
Object code	Object code - Object code, also known as object file, is an intermediate representation of code generated by a compiler after it processes a source code file. Object files contain compact, pre-parsed code, often called binaries, that can be linked with other object files to generate a final executable or code library. An object file is mostly machine code that can be directly executed by a computer's CPU. An object file contains not only the object code, but also relocation information that the linker uses to assemble multiple object files into an executable or library, program symbols (names of variables and functions), and debugging information. 
Object Model	Object Model - An object model is a subkind of data model with primitive concepts identity, state, encapsulation, operations/methods, messages, inheritance, polymorphism/overloading. An object model deals to the properties of objects in general, in a specific computer programming language, technology, notation or methodology that uses them. For example, the Java object model, the COM object model, or the object model of OMT. Such object models are usually defined using concepts such as class, message, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. There is an extensive literature on formalized object models as a subset of the formal semantics of programming languages. 
Object Database	Object Database - Object database refers to a type of database in which information is represented in the form of objects. The database management system for an object database is referred to variously as a ODBMS or OODBMS. Object database technologies becomes useful when: 1) a relational database becomes cumbersome to be used with complex data; 2) data is generally manipulated by application software written using object-oriented programming languages and tools such as C++, Java, Borland Delphi and C#, and the code needed to translate between this representation of the data, and the tuples of a relational database can be tedious to write and time-consuming to execute. 
Object Pool	Object Pool - An object pool is a set of initialised objects that are kept ready to use, rather than allocated and destroyed on demand. A client of the pool will request an object from the pool and perform operations on the returned object. When the client has finished with an object, it returns it to the pool, rather than destroying it. It is a specific type of factory object. Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost; it is most effective in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high, and the number of instantiations in use at any one time is low. 
Object-SQL Mapping	Object-SQL Mapping - Object-SQL mapping, also known as object-relational mapping(O/RM), is a programming technique that links SQL databases to object-oriented language concepts, creating (in effect) a virtual object database. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-SQL mapping, although some programmers opt to code their own object-SQL mapping for their systems. 
Objectworks	Objectworks - Objectworks is an object-oriented development environment developed by ParcPlace, available under Smalltalk and C++.

ODA: Open Document Architecture	ODA: Open Document Architecture - Open Document Architecture (ODA), formerly called Office Document Architecture, is an ISO standard that specifies how documents are represented and transmitted electronically. 
ODBC: Open Database Connectivity	ODBC: Open Database Connectivity - Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a common framework for accessing and altering the contents of databases. It allows developers to use the same coding conventions regardless of the actual database platform implemented on the backend. When a new database type is installed, administrators merely need to install an ODBC driver that supports that platform and existing ODBC software should function normally. ODBC provides a standard software API method for using database management systems (DBMS). The designer of ODBC aimed to make it independent of programming language, database system and operating system. 
ODBMS: Object Database Management System	ODBMS: Object Database Management System - Object Database Management System (ODBMS), also known as Object Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS), refers to the database management system for an object database. Benchmarks between ODBMSs and relational DBMSs have shown that ODBMS can be clearly superior for certain kinds of tasks. The main reason for this is that many operations are performed using navigational rather than declarative interfaces, and navigational access to data is usually implemented very efficiently by following pointers. Critics of ODBMS, suggest that pointer-based techniques are optimized for very specific search routes or viewpoints. However, for general-purpose queries on the same information, pointer-based techniques will tend to be slower and more difficult to formulate than relational. 
ODNT: Object Desktop Network	ODNT: Object Desktop Network - The Object Desktop Network (OD or ODNT) is a software subscription service created by Stardock. Launched in 1995 on OS/2, it transitioned in 1997/98 to the Windows platform. Subscribers typically download Object Desktop components across the Internet using Stardock Central, although CD snapshots are available on request. Once downloaded, users may use released versions of components forever.

Probably the most widely installed OLTP product is IBM's CICS (Customer Information Control System). 
OMG: Object Management Group	OMG: Object Management Group - Object Management Group (OMG) is a consortium, originally aimed at setting standards for distributed object-oriented systems, and now focused on modeling (programs, systems and business processes) as well as model-based standards in some 20 vertical markets. Founded in 1989 by eleven companies (including Hewlett-Packard Company, Apple Computer, American Airlines and Data General), OMG mobilized to create a cross-compatible distributed object standard. The goal was a common portable and interoperable object model with methods and data that work using all types of development environments on all types of platforms. At its founding, OMG set out to create the initial Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard which appeared in 1991. 
OmniPage Professional	OmniPage Professional - OmniPage Professional is a software used in conjunction with a scanner, to scan pictures or documents into the computer. 
OO Language: Object-Oriented Language	OO Language: Object-Oriented Language - Object-oriented language (OO language) is a type of computer programming language that allows or encourages, to some degree, object-oriented programming methods. OO languages can be grouped into several broad classes, determined by the extent to which they support all features and functionality of object-orientation and objects: classes, methods, polymorphism, inheritance, and reusability. 
OODBMS: Object Oriented Database Management System	OODBMS: Object Oriented Database Management System - Object Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS), also known as Object Database Management System (ODBMS), refers to the database management system for an object database. Benchmarks between ODBMSs and relational DBMSs have shown that ODBMS can be clearly superior for certain kinds of tasks. The main reason for this is that many operations are performed using navigational rather than declarative interfaces, and navigational access to data is usually implemented very efficiently by following pointers. Critics of ODBMS, suggest that pointer-based techniques are optimized for very specific search routes or viewpoints. However, for general-purpose queries on the same information, pointer-based techniques will tend to be slower and more difficult to formulate than relational ones. 
OOP: Object-Oriented Programming	OOP: Object-Oriented Programming - Object-oriented programming(OOP) is a computer programming paradigm, in which writing programs in one of a class of programming languages and techniques based on the concept of an object which is a data structure (abstract data type) encapsulated with a set of routines, called methods which operate on the data. Operations on the data can only be performed via these methods, which are common to all objects which are instances of a particular class. Thus the interface to objects is well defined, and allows the code implementing the methods to be changed so long as the interface remains the same. The programming languages support object-oriented programming, including the Java platform and the .NET Framework. 
Open Group	Open Group - The Open Group is an industry consortium that sets vendor- and technology-neutral open standards for computing infrastructure. It was formed when X/Open merged with the Open Software Foundation in 1996. The Open Group is known for its experience in facilitating consensus to develop and evolve standards and best practices. It operates a number of certification programs, including certification for Common Operating Environment (COE) Platform, CORBA, Directory, IT Architects, Linux Standard Base, POSIX, Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF), TOGAF, UNIX, and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). The Open Group is also the owner of the UNIX trademark. 
OPEN LOOK	OPEN LOOK - OPEN LOOK or OpenLook was an early graphical user interface (GUI) specification developed by Sun Microsystems and AT&T in the early 1990s for UNIX workstations. It had its origins in SunOS 2.1, SunView, and Sun's Motorola 68000 based UNIX workstations. 
Open Outsourcing	Open Outsourcing - Open outsourcing, a socio-economic movement resulting from the open source movement and the international outsourcing of programming, refers to a practice of making open source technologies more accessible to businesses and individuals by employing an inexpensive international labor force of programmers, often on a contractual piecework basis. Small businesses may not be technical enough to efficiently utilize open source resources in-house or large enough to hire a full time technician. Larger businesses with IT staff may lack technicians with specific skills or knowledge. 
Open Source	Open Source - Open source refers to practices in production and development of software by a public development community(typically volunteers from many organizations) rather than a single vendor. The source code of open source software is free and available to anyone who would like to use it or modify it for their own purposes. This allows an organization to add a feature itself rather than hope that the vendor of a proprietary product will implement its suggestion in a subsequent release. Some consider open source as a philosophy, and others consider it as a pragmatic methodology of software development. 
Open Source Movement	Open Source Movement - The open source movement is an offshoot of the free software movement that advocates open-source software as an alternative label for free software, primarily on pragmatic rather than philosophical grounds. 
Open64	Open64 - Open64 is an open source optimizing compiler for Intel Itanium platform. It was released by SGI company and now mostly serves as a research platform for compiler and computer architecture research groups.

Open-Source License	Open-Source License - An open-source license is a copyright license for computer software that makes the source code available under terms that allow for modification and redistribution without having to pay the original author. Such licenses may have additional restrictions such as a requirement to preserve the name of the authors and the copyright statement within the code. One popular (and sometimes considered normative) set of open source licenses are those approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) based on their Open Source Definition (OSD). 
OpenTracker	OpenTracker - OpenTracker refers to the open source versions of the Tracker and Deskbar desktop management tools for BeOS. The original Tracker and Deskbar were created by Be, Incorporated, as part of BeOS, but were opensourced in late 2000. It is under the OpenTracker Licence, which is a barely modified BSD licence that allows the use of the Be trademark Tracker to be used. 
Operating Environment	Operating Environment - Operating environment is the environment in which users run programs, whether in a command line interface, such as in MS-DOS, or in a graphical user interface, such as in the Macintosh operating system or Windows. There is a thin line between operating environments and shells (such as Unix shell). Historically, shells are the interfaces to operating systems. They do not actually add any new capabilities; they simply provide a better user interface. So-called intelligent shells, however, actually extend an operating system's capabilities, so there is little difference between intelligent shells and operating environments. 
OPS5: Official Production System	OPS5: Official Production System - Official Production System (OPS5) is a rule-based or production system computer language, notable as the first such language to be used in a successful expert system, the R1/XCON system used to configure VAX computers. The first implementation of OPS5 was written in Lisp, and later rewritten in BLISS for speed. 
Oracle Database	Oracle Database - Oracle database is a relational database management system (DBMS) from Oracle, which runs on more than 80 platforms. The Oracle database, the current version of which is Oracle11i, is Oracle's flagship product. It was introduced in the late 1970s and was the first database product to run on a variety of platforms from micro to mainframe computers. 
ORB: Object Request Broker	ORB: Object Request Broker - An object request broker (ORB), a term in distributed computing, is a piece of middleware software that allows programmers to make program calls from one computer to another, via a network. ORBs handle the transformation of in-process data structures to the byte sequence which is transmitted over the network (of course, also the reverse transformation). This is called marshalling or serialization. ORBs often expose many more features, such as distributed transactions, directory services or real-time scheduling. In the object oriented languages, the ORB is an object, having methods to connect the objects being served. After such an object is connected to the ORB, the methods of that object become accessible for remote invocations. ORB must also have some means to obtain the network address of the object that has now become remote. The typical ORB also has many other methods. 
ORD: Object-Relational Database	ORD: Object-Relational Database - An object-relational database (ORD) is a relational database that allows developers to integrate the database with their own custom data types and methods. The term object-relational database is sometimes used to describe external software products running over traditional DBMSs to provide similar features; these systems are more correctly referred to as object-relational mapping systems. 
ORDBMS: Object-Relational Database Management System	ORDBMS: Object-Relational Database Management System - Object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) is a relational database management system that allows developers to integrate the database with their own custom data types and methods. Whereas RDBMS or SQL-DBMS products focused on the efficient management of data drawn from a limited set of data types (defined by the relevant language standards), an object-relational DBMS allows software developers to integrate their own types and the methods that apply to them into the DBMS. The goal of ORDBMS technology is to allow developers to raise the level of abstraction at which they view the problem domain. 
OS/2: Operating System/2	OS/2: Operating System/2 - Operating System/2 (OS/2) is an operating system created by Microsoft and IBM, later developed by IBM exclusively. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and support for OS/2 is to be discontinued on December 31, 2006. 
OS: Operating System	OS: Operating System - Operating system (OS) is a software program that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer. The OS performs basic tasks, such as controlling and allocating memory, prioritizing the processing of instructions, controlling input and output devices, facilitating networking, and managing files. The OS may be split into a kernel which is always present and various system programs which use facilities provided by the kernel to perform higher-level house-keeping tasks, often acting as servers in a client-server relationship. 
OSD: Open Source Definition	OSD: Open Source Definition - The Open Source Definition(OSD) is used by the Open Source Initiative(OSI) to determine whether or not a software license can be considered open source. The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens. Under the Open Source Definition, licenses must meet ten conditions in order to be considered open source licenses. 
OSF: Open Software Foundation	OSF: Open Software Foundation - Open Software Foundation (OSF) is an organization to create an open standard for an implementation of the Unix operating system. OSF's standard Unix implementation was known as OSF/1 and was first released in 1990, which is not widely deployed. Other well-known standards developed by OSF include Motif and the Common Desktop Environment, respectively a widget toolkit and desktop environment for the X Window System. In 1996, OSF merged with the X/Open Company to become The Open Group. 
OSI: Open Source Initiative	OSI: Open Source Initiative - The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is an organization dedicated to promoting open-source software. Open Source Initiative was founded in February 1998 by Bruce Perens and Eric S. Raymond when Netscape Communications Corporation, published the source code for its flagship Netscape Communicator product as free software, due to lowering profit margins and competition with Microsoft's Internet Explorer software. 
OSID: Open Service Interface Definition	OSID: Open Service Interface Definition - Open Service Interface Definitions (OSIDs) are programmatic interface specifications describing services. These interfaces are specified by the Open Knowledge Initiative (O.K.I.) to implement a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to achieve interoperability among applications across a varied base of underlying and changing technologies. 
OSS/J: OSS Through Java	OSS/J: OSS Through Java - Operations Support System(OSS) through Java (OSS/J) is a kind of middleware to connect different OSS information systems by using Java technologies. The OSS/J initiative has been founded in 2000 by several members. Their primary goal is to develop an open standard for the integration of Operations Support Systems. 
OSS: Open Sound System	OSS: Open Sound System - The Open Sound System (OSS) is a portable sound interface available in 11 different Unix systems. In the case of the Linux kernel, OSS was the only supported sound system used up to the 2.4.x series. Starting with version 2.5, the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) was introduced, and the OSS interface became deprecated by Linux' authors. ALSA contains an optional OSS emulation mode that transparently appears to programs as if it were OSS. 
OSS: Open-Source Software	OSS: Open-Source Software - Open-source software(OSS) is a type of computer software whose source code is available under a copyright license that permits users to study, change, and improve the software, and to redistribute it in modified or unmodified form. Benefits of OSS are that developers can customize programs, and these innovations, in turn, are shared within the programming community so that everyone learns from each other. Linux is one popular example of OSS. 
Outliner	Outliner - An outliner is a special text editor that allows the grouping of text in sections that are organized in a tree (hierarchy) of concepts, an outline. Outline tools can be used for computer programming, collecting or organizing ideas, or project management.
p7zip	p7zip - p7zip is a port of the command line version of the 7-Zip file archiverfamous for its introduction of the high-compression 7z formatto POSIX-conforming operating systems, such as Unix, Linux, Windows NT (or greater version) and Mac OS X. It is free software, available under the LGPL free software license. 
Packaged Software	Packaged Software - Packaged software refers to a commercial application program or collection of programs developed to meet the needs of a variety of users, rather than custom designed for a specific user or company. Packaged software is normally put on a CD (or disks), packaged in a box and sold to the general public. 
Page Recognition	Page Recognition - Page recognition is a feature of software to recognize different kinds of items on a scanned page. Page recognition software can distinguish text from pictures, and converts text on the page into computer characters by means of optical character recognition (OCR). 
Paint Program	Paint Program - Paint program is a type of application that allows a user to paint on the computer screen. Using a mouse or other pointer, the user can select from various drawing and painting tools such as brushes, spray cans, etc. and a full palette of colors. The paint program allows the user to control the color of each pixel. Sophisticated graphics editing capabilities such as screens, filters, etc., can be used. Example ofpaint program include Adobe Illustrate and Coral Draw. 
Parallel Algorithm	Parallel Algorithm - In computer science, a parallel algorithm, as opposed to a traditional serial algorithm, is one which can be executed a piece at a time on many different processing devices, and then put back together again at the end to get the correct result. 
Parallel Compiler	Parallel Compiler - Parallel compiler is a type of computer compiling technique that is used to speed up the process of compilation on multiprocessor machines. Parallel compilers are developed for supercomputers and other large scale multiprocessor machines. 
Parallel Computing	Parallel Computing - Parallel computing is the simultaneous execution of the same task (split up and specially adapted) on multiple processors or multiple computers in order to obtain results faster. The idea is based on the fact that the process of solving a problem usually can be divided into smaller tasks, which may be carried out simultaneously with some coordination. A subtype of parallel algorithms, distributed algorithms are algorithms designed to work in cluster computing and distributed computing environments, where additional concerns beyond the scope of classical parallel algorithms need to be addressed. 
Parallel Port	Parallel Port - Parallel port, also called a female connector, is a socket on a computer for transmitting data in parallel, or more than one bit at a time. There may be eight, 16, or 36 channels; each channel carries one bit of information, so eight channels would be used to transmit one eight-bit byte at a time. Not all the channels are used for data; some maybe used for control signals. A parallel port has 25 holes, and the cable that plugs into it has 25 pins. 
Parallel Processing	Parallel Processing - Parallel processing is a computing architecture within a single computer that performs more than one operation at the same time. Parallel processing can also be achieved by using multiple computers clustered together to procss one part of a large function simultaneously to obtain results faster. 
Parallel Terraced Scan	Parallel Terraced Scan - The parallel terraced scan is a multi-agent based search technique that is basic to cognitive architectures, such as copycat, letter-string, the examiner, tabletop, and others. It was developed by John Rehling and Douglas Hofstadter at the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition at the Indiana University, Bloomington. 
Parser Program	Parser Program - Parser is a computer program to conduct parsing process to determine the syntactic structure of a sentence or string of symbols in some languages. A parser normally takes as input a sequence of tokens output by a lexical analyser. It may produce some kind of abstract syntax tree as output. One of the best known parser generators is yacc. 
Parsing Process	Parsing Process - Parsing process, also known as syntax analysis, refers to the analyzing an input sequence (read from a file or a keyboard, for example) in order to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given formal grammar. Parsing process transforms input text into a data structure, usually a tree, which is suitable for later processing and which captures the implied hierarchy of the input. Generally, parsers operate in two stages, first identifying the meaningful tokens in the input, and then building a parse tree from those tokens. 
Partial Evaluation	Partial Evaluation - Partial evaluation is a technique for program compiling optimization. During compiling, partial evaluation transforms and pre-computes the static data, part of the input data known at compile time, into dynamic data, which in general runs more efficiently. 
Pascal programming Language	Pascal programming Language - Pascal pogramming language is a high-level programming language developed by Niklaus Wirth in the late 1960s based on ALGOL, and named after Blaise Pascal, a seventeenth-century French mathematician who constructed one of the first mechanical adding machines. Pascal is best known for its affinity to structured programming techniques. The nature of the language forces programmers to design programs methodically and carefully. For this reason, it is a popular teaching language. 
Patch	Patch - A patch, so called a service patch or software pacth, refers to a fix to a program bug. A patch is an actual piece of object code that is inserted into (patched into) an executable program. Patches typically are available as downloads over the Internet. 
Pattern Matching	Pattern Matching - Pattern matching is the act of checking for the presence of the constituents of a given pattern. In contrast to pattern recognition, the pattern is rigidly specified. Such a pattern concerns conventionally either sequences or tree structures. Pattern matching is used to check that things have the desired structure, to find relevant structure, to retrieve the aligning parts, and to substitute the matching part with something else. 
Payware	Payware - Payware is a type of Internet downloadable software that has a price and is on sale. It is a commercial software not freeware or shareware. 
PC Weenies	PC Weenies - The PC Weenies is a popular webcomic with a special focus on technology humor and geek culture, as experienced through the lives of the fictitious Weiner family.

PDF: Portable Document Format	PDF: Portable Document Format - Portable Document Format(PDF) is the native file format for Adobe Systems' Acrobat. The PDF file format is independent of the original application software, hardware, and operating system used to create those documents. A PDF file can describe documents containing any combination of text, graphics, and images in a device-independent and resolution independent format. 
PDL: Page Description Language	PDL: Page Description Language - Page Description Language(PDL) is a type of printer language that allows the appearance of a printed page to be described in a high-level, device-independent way. Using PDL, printing then becomes a two-stage process: an application program produces a description in the language, which is then interpreted by a specific output device. Page Description Language can therefore serve as an interchange standard for transmission and storage of printable documents. Examples of PDL are Adobe Systems, Inc.'s PostScript or Xerox's Interpress. 
PEEK and POKE	PEEK and POKE - In computing, PEEK is a BASIC programming language function used for reading the contents of a memory cell at a specified address. The corresponding command to set the contents of a memory cell is POKE. 
Peephole Optimization	Peephole Optimization - Peephole optimization is a kind of optimization performed over a very small set of instructions in a segment of generated code. The set is called a peephole or a window. This kind of optimization makes certain assumptions about the efficiency of instructions. Modern computer architectures typically allow for many hundreds of different kinds of peephole optimizations, and it is therefore often appropriate for compiler programmers to implement them using a pattern matching algorithm. 
People Aggregator	People Aggregator - A people aggregator is a social networking system derived from FOAF that uses open standards, network interconnectivity, and massive flexibility to decentralise social networking on the internet. 
Per Seat	Per Seat - Per seat is a way of licensing software based on the number of workstations on which it will be installed and used.

Planner Programming Language	Planner Programming Language - Planner programming language designed by Carl Hewitt at MIT in 1969. First subsets such as Micro-Planner and Pico-Planner were implemented and then essentially the whole language was implemented in Popler and derivations such as QA-4, Conniver, QLISP and Ether were important tools in Artificial Intelligence research in the 1970's, which influenced the commercial developments of KEE and ART. 
Plugin or Plug-In	Plugin or Plug-In - A plugin (or plug-in) is a type of computer programs that interacts with a main application (a web browser or an email program, for example) to provide a certain, usually very specific, function. Typical examples are plugins that read or edit specific types of files (for instance, multimedia files); encrypt or decrypt email (for instance, PGP); filter images in graphic programs.

PostScript	PostScript - PostScript, a Page Description Language(PDL), is an interpreted, stack-based language (like FORTH). It was used as a page description language by the Apple LaserWriter, and now many laser printers and on-screen graphics systems. Its primary application is to describe the appearance of text, graphical shapes and sampled images on printed or displayed pages. 
POV-Ray: Persistence of Vision Raytracer	POV-Ray: Persistence of Vision Raytracer - Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray) is a free ray tracing program available for a variety of computer platforms. It was originally based on DKBTrace, written by David K. Buck and Aaron A. Collins. 
PowerAnimator	PowerAnimator - PowerAnimator, the precursor to what is now Maya and StudioTools, was an expensive, complex, highly-integrated industrial 3D modeling, animation, and visual effects suite. It was the most widely used non-proprietary software in the visual effects and animation industries, and as such, it has had a long track record, starting with Terminator 2 in 1990 and ending in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in 1999. PowerAnimator ran natively on MIPS based SGI Irix systems up until the late 1990s, when it was ported to the NT platform. 
PowerArchiver	PowerArchiver - PowerArchiver is a commercial file archiver designed for Microsoft Windows users, developed by ConexWare Inc. It uses eg. 7-Zip format, and can also handle a number of other archive formats. It is a commercial product with a free evaluation version. 
PowerBASIC	PowerBASIC - PowerBASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language, based on the Turbo Basic. Its syntax is similar to that of FreeBasic, GW Basic, QBasic and Turbo Basic. PowerBASIC compilers compile to a pure binary form (native code), without an interpreter at all involved. PowerBASIC programs also don't require any external DLLs to run (unless the programmer deliberately designs them to do so). The executable files they create are almost as compact as those written directly in Assembly Language, run fast, and require no runtime files. Unlike Visual Basic (for example) with its large runtime overhead, it is common for a sophisticated application written in PowerBASIC to be so small that it fits on a diskette. 
PPM: Project Portfolio Management	PPM: Project Portfolio Management - Project portfolio management (PPM) refers to a software package that enables corporate and business users to organize a series of projects into a single portfolio that will provide reports based on the various project objectives, costs, resources, risks and other pertinent associations. Project portfolio management software allows the user, usually management or executives within the company, to review the portfolio which will assist in making key business decisions for the projects. 
PRE: Partial Redundancy Elimination	PRE: Partial Redundancy Elimination - Partial redundancy elimination (PRE) is a compiler optimization that eliminates expressions that are redundant on some but not necessarily all paths through a program. PRE is a form of common subexpression elimination (CSE). 
Preemptive	Preemptive - Preemptive is a practice of an operating system if it allows the running task to be suspended when a task of higher priority becomes ready (or a task of equal priority is granted a turn). Non-preemptive schedulers are easier to be implemented but less appropriate for embedded systems, which must be responsive to external events 
Pre-Emptive Multitasking	Pre-Emptive Multitasking - Pre-emptive multitasking, also known as preemptive multithreading, is a form of multitasking where the scheduler can interrupt and suspend (swap out) the currently running task in order to start or continue running (swap in) another task. The tasks under pre-emptive multitasking can be written as though they were the only task and the scheduler decides when to swap them. The scheduler must ensure that when swapping tasks, sufficient state is saved and restored that tasks do not interfere. Preemptive multitasking allows the computer system to more reliably guarantee each process a regular slice of operating time. It also allows the system to rapidly deal with important external events like incoming data, which might require the immediate attention of oneor another process. 
Preprocessor	Preprocessor - A preprocessor is a program that takes text and performs lexical conversions on it. The conversions may include macro substitution, conditional inclusion, and inclusion of other files. 
Priority Inversion	Priority Inversion - Priority inversion is the scenario in which a high-priority task is delayed while waiting for access to a shared resource that is not even being used at the time. This causes the execution of the high priority task to be blocked until the low priority task has released the resource, effectively inverting the relative priorities of the two tasks. If some other medium priority task attempts to run in the interim, it will take precedence over both the low priority task and the high priority task. 
Pro Tools	Pro Tools - Pro Tools is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) by Digidesign for music production and digital audio editing. It is widely used by music and Post professionals in television, and music and serves as the de facto standard in those industries. Pro Tool is one of the first programs to provide CD-quality (16-bit and 44.1 kHz) multitrack editing on a personal computer. 
Procedural Language	Procedural Language - Procedural language, a term used in contrast to declarative language, describes a language where the programmer specifies an explicit sequences of steps to follow to produce a result. Common procedural languages include Basic, Pascal, C and Modula-2. 
Procedure	Procedure - Procedure, in Computer Programming, also called routine, subroutine, and function, is a section of a program that performs a specific task. 
Procedure Programing	Procedure Programing - Procedural programming refers to a programming paradigm based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, methods, or functions simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. Procedural programming is often a better choice than simple sequential or unstructured programming in many situations which involve moderate complexity or which require significant ease of maintainability. 
Processor-Independent Software	Processor-Independent Software - Processor-independent software refers to a type of software that is independent of the processor (or CPU) on which it will be run. Most programs that can be written in a high-level language are processor independent. 
Processor-Specific Software	Processor-Specific Software - Processor-specific software is a type of software that is dependent on the processor(or CPU) on which it will be run. Such code must usually be written in assembly language. Poor design can make a high-level language program processor specific; careless assumptions about the size of longs and ints in C, for example, or explicit accesses to memory that create a particular endianness limit portability. 
Profiler	Profiler - In computer programming, a profiler is a performance analysis tool that measures the behavior of a program as it runs, particularly the frequency and duration of function calls. The output is a stream of recorded events (a trace) or a statistical summary of the events observed (a profile). These statistics include the number of calls to each subroutine and the total amount of time spent within each. This data can be used to learn which subroutines are the most critical and, therefore, demand the greatest code efficiency. Profilers use a wide variety of techniques to collect data, including hardware interrupts, code instrumentation, operating system hooks, and performance counters. 
Program	Program - In computer science, a program, also known as computer program, software, applications program, system software, or software progam, is an organized list of instructions that, when executed, causes the computer to behave in a predetermined manner. 
Programming Language	Programming Language - A programming language is an artificial language that can be used to control the behavior of a machine (often a computer). Programming languages have syntactic and semantic rules used to define meaning. Programming languages are used to facilitate communication about the task of organizing and manipulating information, and to express algorithms precisely. Programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. Each language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions. Each different type of CPU has its own unique lower level language, also known as machine language. 
Programming Macro	Programming Macro - Programming macro is a type of macro that takes a computer program as input and output a new, expanded program. Hence, this process is called macro-expansion and the tool that does this is called a macro-expander. For many programming languages, a macro expander is included in the interpreter or compiler. These macros are typically used to enable a higher level of abstraction in programming languages. 
Programming Tool	Programming Tool - Programming tool, also known as Software tool, is a program or application that software developers use to create, debug, or maintain other programs and applications. The term usually refers to relatively simple programs that can be combined together to accomplish a task, much as one might use multiple hand tools to fix a physical object. 
Prolog	Prolog - Prolog is a logic programming language. It was created by Alain Colmerauer and Robert Kowalski around 1972 as an alternative to the American-dominated Lisp programming languages. It is an attempt to make a programming language that enables the expression of logic instead of carefully specified instructions on the computer. 
Proprietary Software	Proprietary Software - Proprietary software refers to a type of software in which the user does not control what it does or cannot study or edit the code and can not distribute the software without permission of the software copyright owner, in contrast to free software, which can be used, copied, studied, modified and redistributed. 
PSE: Problem Solving Environment	PSE: Problem Solving Environment - A Problem Solving Environment (PSE) is specialized software for solving one class of problems. Many PSEs were introduced in the 1990s. They use the language of the respective field and often employ modern graphical user interfaces the goal is to make the software easy to use for specialists in fields other than computer science. 
Pseudonymous Remailer	Pseudonymous Remailer - Pseudonymous remailer, also known as nym server, as opposed to an anonymous remailer, is an Internet software program designed to allow people to write anonymous messages on Usenet newsgroups and send anonymous email under a pseudonym. Unlike a purely anonymous remailers, it assigns its users a user name, and it keeps a database of instructions on how to return messages to the real user. These instructions usually involve the anonymous remailer network itself, thus protecting the true identity of the user. 
Public-Domain Software	Public-Domain Software - Public-domain software refers to any program that is not copyrighted. Public-domain software is free and can be used without restrictions. The term public-domain software is often used incorrectly to include freeware, free software that is nevertheless copyrighted. 
PUP: Potentially Unwanted Program	PUP: Potentially Unwanted Program - Potentially unwanted program(PUP) is a term used to describe unwanted programs such as Trojans, spyware and adware, along with other malware which may compromise your privacy. Some antivirus and PC security software packages will scan for and protect your system against PUPs. The term PUP was first used by persons at McAfee's Avert research labto avoid any legal issues that may arise from calling these types of applications spyware. 
Purify Memory Debugger	Purify Memory Debugger - Purify memory debugger program is used by software developers to detect memory access errors in programs, especially those written in C or C++. It was originally written by Reed Hastings of Pure Software, now part of IBM. Purify allows dynamic verification, a process by which a program discovers errors that occur when the program runs, much like a debugger. Static verification or static code analysis, by contrast, involves detecting errors in the source code without ever compiling or running it, just by discovering logical inconsistencies. The type checking by a C compiler is an example of static verification. 
PWB Shell	PWB Shell - The PWB shell, also known as the Mashey shell, was an early Unix shell distributed with some versions of Programmer's Workbench UNIX circa 1975-1977. It was a modified version of the Thompson shell with additional features to increase usability for programming, and was maintained by John Mashey and various others. Although it was soon superseded by the Bourne shell, several features introduced in the PWB shell remain in many later shells. 
PyGTK	PyGTK - PyGTK is a set of Python wrappers for the GTK+ GUI library. PyGTK is free software and licensed under the LGPL. Its original author is famous GNOME hacker James Henstridge, but today there are six people in the team that maintains the bindings as well as a countless number of other helpers that have submitted patches and bug reports. 
PyQt	PyQt - PyQt is the Python binding of the GUI toolkit Qt. PyQt is developed by the British firm Riverbank Computing. It is available under similar terms as Qt: for free (GPL'ed) under Linux, commercially under Mac/OS and Windows. 
Python	Python - Python is an interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1990. Python is fully dynamically typed and uses automatic memory management; it is thus similar to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, Smalltalk, and Tcl. Python is developed as an open source project, managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation, and is available for free from the project website.
QB: QuickBASIC	QB: QuickBASIC - Microsoft QuickBASIC (QB) is a descendant of the BASIC programming language that was developed by the Microsoft Corporation for use with the MS-DOS operating system. It is loosely based on GW-BASIC but adds user-defined types, improved programming structures, better graphics and disk support and a compiler in addition to the interpreter. Microsoft sold QuickBASIC as a commercial development suite. 
Qbasic	Qbasic - QBasic is a variant of the BASIC programming language, which is similar but different from the QuickBasic programming language. The source code is compiled to an intermediate form within the integrated development environment (IDE), and this intermediate form is immediately interpreted on demand within the IDE. Like QuickBASIC, but unlike earlier versions of Microsoft BASIC, QBasic was a structured programming language, supporting constructs such as named subroutines and while loops. Line numbers, a concept often associated with BASIC, were supported for compatibility, but were not necessary and not considered good form, having been replaced by descriptive line labels. QBasic has limited support for user-defined data types (structures), and several primitive types used to contain strings of text or numeric data. 
Qcad	Qcad - QCad is a computer-aided design (CAD) software package for 2D design and drafting. It is available for Linux, Mac OS X, Unix and Microsoft Windows. QCad is developed by RibbonSoft and released under the GPL. QCad 2, designed to make QCad more productive, more user friendly, more flexible and increase its compatibility with other products began development in May 2002. Much of the interface and concepts behind use are the same of those of AutoCAD, though perhaps easier to understand in QCad. QCad is one of very few OpenSource CAD packages available for Linux, and certainly the most fully functional. QCad uses the AutoCAD DXF file format internally and to save and import files. Files can be exported in a number of formats, but noticeably missing are both VRML and SVG. 
QTW: QuickTime for Windows	QTW: QuickTime for Windows - QuickTime for Windows(QTW) is a multimedia software from Apple Computer that integrates full-motion video and sound into application programs. 
Query Language	Query Language - Query languages are computer languages used to make queries into databases and information systems. Broadly, query languages can be classified according to whether they are database query languages or information retrieval query languages. Examples of query language includes: SQL is a well known query language for relational databases; MDX is a query language for OLAP databases; DMX is a query language for Data Mining models; Datalog is a query language for deductive databases; XQuery is a query language for XML data sources. 
Query Optimizer	Query Optimizer - The query optimizer is the component of a database management system that is used to analyze queries submitted to database server for execution, and then determine the optimal way to execute the query (Query plan).The query optimizer cannot be accessed directly by users. Instead, once queries are submitted to database server, and parsed by the parser, they are then passed to the query optimizer where optimization occurs. 
Query Plan	Query Plan - A query plan, also known as query execution plan, is an ordered set of steps used to access information in a SQL relational database management system. This is a specific case of the relational model concept of access plans. Since SQL is declarative, there are typically a large number of alternative ways to execute a given query, with widely varying performance. When a query is submitted to the database, the query optimizer evaluates all of the different possible plans for executing the query and returns what it considers the best alternative. 
QuickTime	QuickTime - QuickTime is a multimedia framework developed by Apple Computer, capable of handling various formats of digital video, media clips, sound, text, animation, music, and several types of interactive panoramic images. The QuickTime technology has three major components: 1) a media player, known as QuickTime Player, which Apple makes available for free download on its website and bundles with each of its computers; 2) the QuickTime file format openly documented and available for anyone to use royalty-free; 3) software development kits available for the Macintosh and Windows platforms. These kits allow people to develop their own software to manipulate QuickTime and other media files. These are not free. 
QVCS	QVCS - QVCS is a family of version control system products published by Quma Software, Inc. The QVCS product family supplies version control system with features similar to many other version control products on the market. QVCS and QVCS-Pro target smaller Windows only development teams. QVCS-Enterprise is a client-server application, is cross-platform, and is designed for use by distributed development teams.
R Programming Language	R Programming Language - The R programming language, sometimes described as GNU S, is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It was originally created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (hence the name R) at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is now developed by the R core team. R is considered by its developers to be an implementation of the S programming language, with semantics derived from Scheme. 
Racter: Raconteur	Racter: Raconteur - Racter, short from raconteur, was an artificial intelligence computer program that generated English language prose at random. Its existence was revealed to the world in 1984. The great sophistication claimed for the program was, however, a hoax, as could be seen by investigation of the template system of text generation. 
Rainlender	Rainlender - Rainlendar is an open-source computer application that displays a calendar on the desktop. It also can maintain events and a to-do list. It is popular because it uses few system resources when running, and supports skins or GUI changes. Because of the ability to be skinned, it has become a mainstay on many shell replacement themes (such as Litestep and Aston). The name Rainlendar is a combination of 'Rainy' and calendar. 
RAR: Roshal Archive	RAR: Roshal Archive - In computing, RAR, short of Roshal ARchive, is a proprietary file format for data compression and archiving, which was developed by Eugene Roshal (hence the name RAR: Roshal ARchive). He also developed programs for packing and unpacking RAR files, originally for DOS, and later ported to other platforms. The encoder (the main Windows version known as WinRAR) is distributed as shareware, but Roshal has released the decoder's source code under a license that allows free distribution and modification, on condition that it is not used to build a compatible encoder. The encoding method is held to be proprietary, but compatible programs for decompression are available for several platforms, such as the open-source 7-Zip. 
RDBMS: Relational Database Management System	RDBMS: Relational Database Management System - A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by Edgar F. Codd. However commercial RDBMSs also tend to diverge from the relational model in significant ways. The qualify as a RDBMS, the system must satisfy the following minimum criteria: 1) presented the data to the user as relations (a presentation in tabular form, i.e. as a collection of tables with each table consisting of a set of rows and columns, can satisfy this property); 2) provided relational operators to manipulate the data in tabular form. 
RealSky	RealSky - RealSky is a digital photographic sky atlas, which is a subset of the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) published in 1996 by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. RealSky is composed of the RealSky product, covering the northern sky, and RealSky South, published slightly later and covering the southern sky. 
Recursive	Recursive - Recursive in computer programming refers to software that calls itself. Recursion should generally be avoided in an embedded system, since it frequently requires a large stack. 
Redundant Code	Redundant Code - Redundant code, also known as duplicate code, refers to the code in a computer program that is executed but has no effect on the output of a program, because this piece of code is the second and subsequent copies of functionaly the same code executed somewhere else. 
Reentrant	Reentrant - Reentrant refers to software that can be executed multiple times simultaneously. A reentrant function can be safely called recursively or from multiple tasks. The key to making code reentrant is to ensure mutual exclusion whenever accessing global variables or shared registers. 
Refactoring	Refactoring - Refactoring is the process of rewriting a computer program or other material to improve its structure or readability, while explicitly preserving its meaning or behavior. For example, if a programmer wants to add new functionality to a program, he may decide to refactor the program first to simplify the addition of new functionality in order to prevent software entropy. 
Register Allocation	Register Allocation - In compiler optimization, register allocation is the process of multiplexing a large number of target program variables onto a small number of CPU registers.Most computer programs need to process large amounts of different data items. However, most CPUs can only perform operations on a small fixed number of slots called registers. Even on machines that support memory operands, register access is considerably faster than memory access. 
Register Spilling	Register Spilling - Register spilling occurs during a program compilation where there are more live variables than the register can hold. When a compiler is generating machine code and there are more live variables than the machine has registers, it has to transfer or spill some variables from registers to memory. This incurrs at certain cost, as access from memory is typically slower than access from a register. 
Regression Testing	Regression Testing - Regression testing is any type of software testing which seeks to uncover regression bugs. Regression bugs occur whenever software functionality that previously worked as desired stops working or no longer works in the same way that was previously planned. Typically regression bugs occur as an unintended consequence of program changes. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previously run tests and checking whether previously fixed faults have reemerged. 
Relational Database	Relational Database - A relational database is a database structured in accordance with the relational model. Strictly speaking the term refers to a specific collection of data but it is invariably employed together with the software used to manage that collection of data. That software is more correctly called a relational database management system (RDBMS). Relational database management systems incorporate many features from the relational model, but commercial RDBMSs also tend to diverge from the relational model in significant ways. 
Relational Model	Relational Model - The relational model, a mathematical model invented by Edgar Codd, is a data model for database management based on predicate logic and set theory. The fundamental assumption of the relational model is that all data is represented as mathematical n-ary relations, an n-ary relation being a subset of the Cartesian product of n domains. In the mathematical model, reasoning about such data is done in two-valued predicate logic, meaning there are two possible evaluations for each proposition: either true or false (and in particular, no third value such as unknown, or not applicable, either of which is often associated with the concept of NULL). Some think that logic (which is inherently two-valued) is an important part of the relational model, where others think that a system that uses a form of three-valued logic can still be considered relational. 
Rematerialization	Rematerialization - Rematerialization is a compiler optimization method which saves time by recomputing a value instead of loading it from memory. It is typically tightly integrated with register allocation, where it is used as an alternative to spilling registers to memory. 
Remote Control Software	Remote Control Software - Remote control software is a type of software used in remote administration to allow use of computers or other hardware at a separate location. A typical use is to control a server or desktop computer from another desktop computer. The remote control software consists of two separate computer programs, a host version that is installed on the computer to be controlled, and a remote version that is installed on the controlling computer. Remote control operation is used to take control of an unattended desktop personal computer from a remote locationas well as to provide instruction and technical support to remote users. 
Renegade BBS	Renegade BBS - Renegade is a bulletin board system (BBS) written for IBM PC-compatible computers running MS-DOS. It was written in Pascal by Cott Lang and gained popularity in the early 1990s. Renegade is based on the source code to Telegard, and was available free of charge. This was one of the reasons it became the most popular BBS software in use at the time. 
Report Writer	Report Writer - Report writer , also called a report generator, is a program, usually part of a database management system, that extracts information from one or more files and presents the information in a specified format.

Repository Open Service Interface Definition	Repository Open Service Interface Definition - The Repository Open Service Interface Definition (OSID) is an O.K.I. specification which defines the storing and retrieving of digital content, referred to as Assets. OSIDs are programmtic interfaces which comprise a Service Oriented Architecture for designing and building reusable and interoperable software. Assets may contain metadata and reside in Repositories which support one or more Asset Types. Multiple repositories can be managed or searched through the use of OSID adapter patterns where underneath a single Repository OSID can exist multiple Repository OSIDs forming a federation of repositories, where each implementation may be using a distinct incompatible technology and the OSID integrates them. 
Revision Control	Revision Control - Revision control, also known as version control or source control, is the management of multiple revisions of the same unit of information and information systems. It is most commonly used in engineering and software development to manage ongoing development of digital documents like application source code, art resources such as blueprints or electronic models and other critical information that may be worked on by a team of people. Changes to these documents are identified by incrementing an associated number or letter code, termed the revision number, revision level, or simply revision and associated historically with the person making the change. A simple form of revision control, for example, has the initial issue of a drawing assigned the revision number 1. When the first change is made, the revision number is incremented to 2 and so on. 
Revision Control System	Revision Control System - Revision control system manages multiple revisions to a single unit of information, typically a digital document containing source code. It is most commonly used in engineering and software development to manage ongoing development of digital documents like application source code, art resources such as blueprints or electronic models and other critical information that may be worked on by a team of people. Changes to these documents are identified by incrementing an associated number or letter code, termed the revision number, revision level, or simply revision and associated historically with the person making the change. 
Rewind	Rewind - Rewind is an open source project to implement a compatibility layer for the Microsoft Windows API on UNIX with X11. It supports FreeBSD, Solaris and Linux. It grew out of the original MIT Licensed WINE project after WINE changed its license to the GNU LGPL in March 2002.

It supports cooperative multitasking with memory management and includes a graphical user interface or WIMP. 
RKWard	RKWard - RKWard is an easy to use, transparent frontend to the R programming language, a very powerful, yet hard-to-get-into scripting-language with a strong focus on statistic functions. RKWard tries to combine the power of the R-language with the ease of use of commercial statistical packages. 
ROBODoc	ROBODoc - ROBODoc is a documentation tool similar to javadoc. It is used to extract API documentation from source code. It can be used with any language that supports remarks and works by extracting specially formated headers. These are then reformatted into HTML, DocBook, TROFF, ASCII, LaTeX, PDF, or RTF. 
Robustness	Robustness - In the context of computer software, robustness is the resilience of the system, especially when under stress or when confronted with invalid input. For example, an operating system is considered robust if it operates correctly when it is starved of memory or storage space, or when confronted with an application that has bugs or is behaving in an illegal fashion - such as trying to access memory or storage belonging to other tasks in a multitasking system. 
ROFUG: Romanian FreeBSD Users Group	ROFUG: Romanian FreeBSD Users Group - Romanian FreeBSD Users Group(ROFUG), also known as Romanian Free Unix Group, is a FreeBSD user group with the main objective to form a Romanian user community centered around FreeBSD and the open source concept.

For example, rsh can be used to remotely examine the status of a number of access servers without connecting to each communication server, executing the command, and then disconnecting from the communication server. rsh originated as part of the BSD Unix operating system as part of the rlogin package on 4.2BSD in 1983. rsh has since been ported to other operating systems. rsh is mostly replaced by a more secured protocol called Secure Shell protocol(SSH) in today's environment. 
RTM: Release to Manufacturing	RTM: Release to Manufacturing - Release to manufacturing (RTM), in software industry, refers to the process of providing the version of a software product to manufacturers to bundle into future versions of their hardware products. RTM versions are typically released to manufacturers before they are released to the general public so that the manufacturers can conduct integration and work out any bugs the software may encounter with hardware devices. The release of an RTM version does not necessarily mean that the creators have worked out all the problems with the software; there still may be more versions of the product before it is released to the general public. 
Rtorrent	Rtorrent - rTorrent is a command line ncurses BitTorrent client written in C++, based on the libTorrent libraries. for Unices, with a focus on high performance and good code. The library differentiates itself from other implementations by transfering directly from file pages to the network stack. On high-bandwidth connections it is able to seed at 3 times the speed of the official client. rTorrent packages are available for Arch Linux, Debian, FreeBSD, Gentoo Linux and Mandriva Linux; of course, rTorrent will compile on nearly every POSIX-compliant OS. 
RTOS: Real-Time Operating System	RTOS: Real-Time Operating System - Real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system designed specifically for use in real-time systems and applications. Examples include embedded applications (programmable thermostats, household appliance controllers, mobile telephones), industrial robots, industrial control, and scientific research equipment. A real-time operating system does not necessarily have high throughput the specialized scheduling algorithm and a high clock-interrupt rate can both interfere with throughput. That is to say, RTOS are valued more for how quickly they can respond to input than for the total amount of work they can do. 
RTSC: Read the Source Code	RTSC: Read the Source Code - Read the Source Code (RTSC) is an acronym often used when a software developer asks a question about undocumented code. 
Ruby Programming Language	Ruby Programming Language - Ruby Programming Language is a reflective, object-oriented programming language.

Runtime Environment	Runtime Environment - A runtime environment, in computer science, is a virtual machine state which provides software services for processes or programs while a computer is running. It may pertain to the operating system itself, or the software that runs beneath it. 
Runtime Error	Runtime Error - Runtime error is a type of program errors that exposed when the program is running. Logical errors and array bounds checking are examples. For this reason, some programming bugs are not discovered until the program is tested in a live environment with real data, despite sophisticated compile-time checking and pre-release testing. In this case, the end user may encounter a runtime error message. 
Runtime Library	Runtime Library - A runtime library, in computer science, refers to a collection of utility functions which support a program while it is running, working with the operating system to provide facilities such as mathematical functions, input and output. These make it unnecessary for programmers to continually rewrite basic capabilities specified in a programming language or provided by an operating system. 
RUP: Rational Unified Process	RUP: Rational Unified Process - Rational Unified Process(RUP) is a software development methodology from Rational. Based on UML, RUP organizes the development of software into four phases, each consisting of one or more executable iterations of the software at that stage of development. 
Rzip	Rzip - rzip is a data compression program based on bzip2. rzip operates in two stages. The first stage finds and encodes large chunks of duplicated data over potentially very long distances (up to nearly a gigabyte) in the input file.

Screen Scraper	Screen Scraper - Screen scraper is a type of software that allows a PC to intercept character-based data from a mainframe and present it in an easier to understand graphical user interface (GUI ). Newer screen scrapers present the information in HTML, so it can be accessed with a browser. The key element that distinguishes screen scraping from regular parsing is that the output being scraped was nominally intended for human consumption, not machine interpretation. There are a number of synonyms for screen scraping, including: Data scraping, data extraction, web scraping, page scraping, web page wrapping and HTML scraping (the last four being specific to scraping web pages). 
ScreenCam	ScreenCam - ScreenCam is an early Screencast program from Lotus that can be used to make movies demonstrating how software works by moving through actions on the screen.Voice can be added, and a ScreenCam player can be included with the movie file so that it runs by itself. 
Screencast	Screencast - A screencast is a digital recording of computer screen output, often containing audio narration.

It manages video, events, numeric audio, CD-ROM sound, threads, and timers. 
SDLC: Systems Development Life Cycle	SDLC: Systems Development Life Cycle - Systems Development Life Cycle(SDLC) is defined by the United States Department of Justice as a software development process, although it is also a distinct process independent of software or other Information Technology considerations. It is used by a system analyst to develop an information system, including requirements, validation, training, and user ownership through investigation, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance. SDLC is a systems approach to problem solving and is made up of several phases, each comprised of multiple steps:  1. The software concept - identifies and defines a need for the new system. 2. A requirements analysis - analyzes the information needs of the end users. 3. The architectural design - creates a blueprint for the design with the necessary specifications for the hardware, software, people and data resources. 4. Coding and debugging - creates and programs the final system. 5. System testing - evaluates the system's actual functionality in relation to expected or intended functionality. 
SDML: Signed Document Markup Language	SDML: Signed Document Markup Language - Signed Document Markup Language(SDML) is a specification of a generic method for digitally signing a document, a section of a document, or multiple documents together. SDML requires the use of public key cryptography and can be used with web pages, e-mail messages or any text based documents.

Search engines use regularly updated indexes to operate quickly and efficiently. Without further qualification, search engine usually refers to a Web search engine, which searches for information on the public Web. Other kinds of search engine are enterprise search engines, which search on intranets, personal search engines, which search individual personal computers, and mobile search engines. However, while different selection and relevance criteria may apply in different environments, the user will probably perceive little difference between operations in these. 
Search Service	Search Service - Search service is an online service which can trawl through the contents of the Web (Websites, newsgroups, email addresses) looking for specific phrases or words. A search engine is required to provide the search services, which asks the user to input keywords and then provides a list of web sites that contain your chosen words. 
Second Generation Language	Second Generation Language - Second generation language (2GL), also known as second-generation programming language, usually refer to some form of assembly language. Unlike first-generation programming languages, the code can be read and written fairly easily by a human, but it must be converted into a machine readable form in order to run on a computer. The conversion process is simply a mapping of the assembly language code into binary machine code (the first-generation language). The language is specific to and dependent on a particular processor family and environment. Since it is the native language of a processor it has significant speed advantages, but it requires more programming effort and is difficult to use effectively for large applications. 
Second-System Effect	Second-System Effect - In computing, the second-system effect, also known as second-system syndrome, refers to the phenomenon when one is designing the successor to a relatively small, elegant, and successful system to become grandiose in one's success and design an elephantine feature-laden monstrosity, for example, the jump from a set of simple operating systems on the IBM 700/7000 series to OS/360 on the 360 series. 
Security-Enhanced Linux	Security-Enhanced Linux - Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a version of the Linux kernel and utilities, which contains support for mandatory access controls based on the principle of least privilege.

SGML: Standard Generalized Markup Language	SGML: Standard Generalized Markup Language - Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML) is a metalanguage for how to specify a document markup language or tag set. Such a specification is itself a document type definition (DTD). SGML is a descendant of IBM's Generalized Markup Language (GML). SGML is based on the idea that documents have structural and other semantic elements that can be described without reference to how such elements should be displayed. The actual display of such a document may vary, depending on the output medium and style preferences. SGML provides a variety of markup syntaxes that can be used for many applications. By changing the SGML Declaration one does not even need to use angle brackets although they are the norm, the so-called concrete reference syntax. SGML was originally designed to enable the sharing of machine-readable documents in large projects in government, legal and the aerospace industry, which have to remain readable for several decadesa very long time in information technology. It has also been used extensively in the printing and publishing industries, but its complexity has preventedits widespread application for small-scale general-purpose use. 
Shareaza	Shareaza - Shareaza is a Windows based peer-to-peer client which supports the Gnutella, Gnutella2, EDonkey Network, and BitTorrent network protocols and which can handle magnet links, ed2k links, Piolet links, and the now deprecated Gnutella links. It was originally developed as closed-sourcefreeware by Michael Stokes, and is now open-source under the GPL. 
Shareware	Shareware - Shareware is a type of software distributed on the basis of an honor system. Most shareware is delivered free of charge, but the author usually requests that you pay a small fee if you like the program and use it regularly. By sending the small fee, you become registered with the producer so that you can receive service assistance and updates. You may re-distribute shareware to others, but they too are expected to pay a fee if they use the product and like it. Sometmes, shareware is a light version of a commercial software, which has price. The author of the shareware expects a portion of users of the shareware to purchase the full commercial version if they like it. 
Shelfware	Shelfware - Shelfware refers to the software that gets purchased by a company or individual that ends up sitting on a shelf somewhere and not being used. 
Shell	Shell - A shell, in computer technologies, refers to the interface between the user and the computer's operating system. The shell interprets commands entered by the user, and passes them on to the operating system. A shell usually implies an interface with a command syntax (think of the DOS operating system and its C:> prompts and user commands such as dir and edit). DOS shells are COMMAND.COM and DOS shell; some UNIX shells are the Bourne shell (sh), the C shell (csh), and the Korn shell (ksh).

SIT: System Integration Testing	SIT: System Integration Testing - The System Integration Testing(SIT), also known as integration testing, is the phase of software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It follows unit testing and precedes system testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been checked out by unit testing, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an Integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing. The purpose of Integration testing is to verify functional, performance and reliability requirements placed on major design items. 
SLOC: Source Lines of Code	SLOC: Source Lines of Code - Source lines of code (SLOC) is a software metric used to measure the amount of code in a software program. SLOC is typically used to estimate the amount of effort that will be required to develop a program, as well as to estimate productivity or effort once the software is produced. 
Smalltalk	Smalltalk - Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language. It was designed and created in part for educational use, more so for Constructivist teaching, at Xerox PARC during the 1970s. The language was generally released as Smalltalk-80 and has been widely used since. Smalltalk is in continuing active development, and has gathered a loyal community of users around it. 
SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture	SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture - Service-Oriented Architecture expresses a perspective of software architecture that defines the use of services to support the requirements of software users. In an SOA environment, resources on a network are made available as independent services that can be accessed without knowledge of their underlying platform implementation. SOA is a style of multi-tier computing that helps organizations share logic and data among multiple applications and usage modes. A number of common terms have surfaced in association with structured service and SOA delivery processes: 1. service-oriented analysis 2. service-oriented design 3. service-oriented analysis and design (SOAD) 4. service-modeling 5. service-oriented modeling 6. service-oriented modeling and architecture (SOMA)
SOAD: Service-Oriented Analysis and Design	SOAD: Service-Oriented Analysis and Design - Service-oriented analysis and design (SOAD), also known as service-oriented modeling, is an IBM defined process following the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), which is an approach to software modeling and development specially designed for service-oriented architecture (SOA). SOAD adds innovations for service repositories, service orchestration, and the enterprise service bus. It also helps design, build, aggregate, and deploy applications as Web services based on SOAP, WSDL and UDDI technologies. 
SOAR Cognitive Architecture	SOAR Cognitive Architecture - SOAR (also spelled Soar) is a symbolic cognitive architecture, created by John Laird, Allen Newell, and Paul Rosenbloom at Carnegie Mellon University. It is both a view of what cognition is and an implementation of that view through a computer programming architecture for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Since its beginnings in 1983 and its presentation on a paper in 1987 it has been widely used by AI researchers to model different aspects of human behavior. 
Social Software	Social Software - Social software is a type of software that enables people to rendezvous, connect or collaborate through computer-mediated communication and to form online communities. Broadly conceived, this term could encompass older media such as mailing lists and Usenet, but some would restrict its meaning to more recent software genres such as blogs and wikis. Others suggest that the term social software is best used not to refer to a single type of software, but rather to the use of two or more modes of computer-mediated communication that result in community formation. In this view, people form online communities by combining one-to-one (e.g., email and instant messaging), one-to-many (Web pages and blogs), and many-to-many (wikis) communication modes. In many online communities, real life meetings become part of the communication repertoire. 
SoftICE	SoftICE - SoftICE is a kernel mode debugger for Microsoft Windows. It is designed to run underneath Windows such that the operating system is unaware of its presence. Unlike an application debugger, SoftICE is capable of suspending all operations in Windows when instructed. For driver debugging this is critcal due to how hardware is accessed and the kernel of the operating system functions. 
Softimage|XSI	Softimage|XSI - Softimage|XSI is a high-end three-dimensional (3D) graphics application developed by Softimage, Co., a subsidiary of Avid Technology, Inc., which is used predominantly in the film, gaming and advertising industries for the production of 3D environments and scenes. 
Software	Software - Software, sometimes abreviated s/w, is also called a computer program that enables a computer is also called a computer program that enables a computer to perform a specific task, as opposed to the physical components of the system (hardware). This includes application software such as a word processor, which enables a user to perform a task, and system software such as an operating system, which enables other software to run properly, by interfacing with hardware and with other software. Programs stored on non-volatile storage built from integrated circuits (e.g. ROM or PROM) are usually called firmware. 
Software Agent	Software Agent - A software agent is an unit or component in a logical model that describes software that acts for a user or other program in a relationship of agency. A software agent is typically a piece of autonomous, or semi-autonomous proactive and reactive, computer software. Many individual communicative software agents may form a multi-agent system multi-agent system (MAS) is a system composed of several agents, capable of mutual interaction. The interaction can be in the form of message passing or producing changes in their common environment. The agents can be autonomous entities, such as software agents or robots. 
Software Architecture	Software Architecture - Software Architecture refers to a static framework or structure that provides the form of a software system and the conventions, policies, and mechanisms for composing itself with subsystems, or component parts, that can populate the architecture. The architecture defines how the parts relate to each other including constraints governing how they can relate, or there are interfaces that define how the parts intercommunicate. 
Software Audit	Software Audit - Software audit refers to the investigation of the software installed on the computers in an organisation with the purpose of ensuring that it is all legal and authorised. Software audits minimise the risk of prosecution for software piracy due to the use of unlicensed software. In addition to enforce software usage policy, the risk of viruses is minimised by preventing uncontrolled software copying. 
Software Blacklist	Software Blacklist - Software blacklisting is a tool used by manufacturers of software and music on CD and DVD, which will audit the user's computer for certain types of virtual CD and CD authoring software. If blacklisted software is found then certain actions are taken by the software on the game or music disc. Examples would be allowing the copying of the game to take place, but crashing the copied game when attempting to start it; allowing copies of games that will malfunction in subtle ways; simply disallowing the game to be run while this software exists etc. 
Software Cracking	Software Cracking - Software cracking refers to the modification of software to remove encoded copy prevention. Distribution of cracked software is generally an illegal act of copyright infringement. 
Software Engineering	Software Engineering - Software engineering refers to a systematic approach to the analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of software, in which technologies and practices from computer science, project management, engineering, application domains and other fields, are applied. There are various models of the software life-cycle, and many methodologies for the different phases. 
Software Entropy	Software Entropy - Software entropy refers to the tendency for software, over time, to become difficult and costly to maintain. A software system that undergoes continuous change, such as having new functionality added to its original design or fitting into the latest technology environment, will eventually become more complex and disorganized as it grows, losing its original design structure. At some point, it may be better to redesign the software in order to support the changes rather than building on the existing program, which, however, maybe quite costly and introduce new bugs and problems. 
Software Environment	Software Environment - Software environment typically refers the environment to support an application, which may include the operating system, the database system, specific development tools or compiler. 
Software Generic	Software Generic - Software Generic refers to the system operating software release for general availability, for example, SUN Solaris 10 etc. 
Software Genre	Software Genre - Software Generic refers to the system operating software released for general availability, for example, SUN Solaris 10 etc. 
Software Hoarding	Software Hoarding - Software hoarding is the creation of proprietary software products based on free licensed software. This software forking can cause interoperability problems leading to vendor lock-in, as well as a limitation of knowledge. The practice of software hoarding was the impetus for the creation of copyleft. Software hoarding is legal unless restricted by copyleft or a similar license, but it is considered immoral by the more ideological proponents of free software. 
Software License	Software License - A software license is an agreemt with certain terms and conditions that grant permission to do things with computer software that would otherwise be prohibited by copyright law. If one does not follow the terms of the license, then he or she is subject to the normal restrictions of copyright law. For example, a software license might give permission to use and to make copies of the software. A copyright holder of software may offer a software license unilaterally, or as part of a software license agreement with another party. There are a variety of different types of software licenses. Some are based on the number machines on which the licensed program can run whereas others are based on the number of users that can use the program. Most personal computer software licenses allow you to run the program on only one machine and to make copies of the software only for backup purposes. Some licenses also allow you to run the program on different computers as long as you don't use the copies simultaneously. 
Software Licensing	Software Licensing - Software licensing refers to the practice of allowing an individual or group to use (or to do other things such as copy) a piece of software, by the copyright owner of the software. Nearly all software applications are licensed rather than sold. A software is licensed by owners in a variety of ways, including: shrink wrap contract accompanying the software, free software license accompanying open-source software which is typically made freely available in source code form, and enterprise software licenses which are agreements the terms of which are specifically negotiated between the licensee and licensor. 
Software Life-Cycle	Software Life-Cycle - Software life-cycle, a terms used in the software engineering, refers to the phases a software product goes through between when it is conceived and when it is no longer available for use. The software life-cycle typically includes the following: requirements analysis, design, construction, testing (validation), installation, operation, maintenance, and retirement. 
Software Metric	Software Metric - A software metric is a quantitative measure of some property of a piece of software or its specifications. Common software metrics include: 01. order of growth 02. source lines of code 03. cyclomatic complexity 04. function points 05. bugs per line of code 06. code coverage 07. Number of lines of customer requirements. 08. number of classes and interfaces 09. Robert Cecil Martin's software package metrics 10. cohesion 11. Coupling
Software Package	Software Package - A software package is a method for the distribution and installation of software on computer systems. The most common type of software package is that found sold in stores, such as a popular word processor. A user would purchase the software, then follow the given instructions to install the software on their home machine. Packaged software is generally designed to appeal to a large audience of users, and although the programs may be tailored to a user's taste by setting various preferences, it is not as individualized as custom-designed and custom-programmed software. 
Software Pipelining	Software Pipelining - Software pipelining is a technique used to optimize loops, in a manner that parallels hardware pipelining. Software pipelining is a type of out-of-order execution, except that the reordering is done by a compiler (or in the case of hand written assembly code, by the programmer) instead of the processor. Some computer architectures have explicit support for software pipelining, notably Intel's IA-64 architecture. 
Software Piracy	Software Piracy - Software piracy refers to the unauthorized duplication and use of computer software. Although some software piracy is done by companies for financial gain, most piracy is done by private individuals who lend discs to friends or copy programs from the workplace to their computers at home. Because computer data is so easy to duplicate, and the use of unauthorized software is so hard to detect, it appears impossible to stop software piracy. In old days, software vendors sell each copy of their software with a dongle   a coded plug that must actually be fitted to the computer for the software to function. 
Software Project Life Cycle	Software Project Life Cycle - Software project life cycle refers to the various stages of development of a program (software), from the identification of requirements, design, coding, testing to the installation, maintenance, and support of the finished program. 
Software Rot	Software Rot - Software rot, also known as code rot or software decay, is a type of bit rot. It describes the perceived slow deterioration of software overtime, that will eventually lead to it becoming faulty, unusable, or otherwise in need of maintenance. Software rot comes in two forms: 1) Dormant Rot: Software that is not (yet) being used gradually becomes unusable as the remainder of the application changes. It has been observed that un-used software has a half life of perhaps one year; 2) Active Rot: Software that is being continuously modified tends to lose its integrity over time. 
Software Sampler	Software Sampler - A software sampler, similar to a software synthesizer, is a software synthesizer generates sounds algorithmically from Mathematically -described tones or short-term waveforms (i.e., less than 100ms in length). A software sampler always reproduces samples, often much longer than a second, as the first step of its algorithm. 
Software Suite	Software Suite - Software suite refers to a collection of programs sold together as one package. Programs within the suite are generally supplementary to each other in functions. For example, an office software suite might include a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation program, and a database program.Some software suites are Lotus SmartSuite, Novell PerfectOffice, and ClarisWorks. 
Software Theft	Software Theft - Software theft, also known as software piracy, refers to the unauthorized duplication and use of computer software. Although some software piracy is done by companies for financial gain, most piracy is done by private individuals who lend discs to friends or copy programs from the workplace to their computers at home. Because computer data is so easy to duplicate, and the use of unauthorized software is so hard to detect, it appears impossible to stop software piracy. In old days, software vendors sell each copy of their software with a dongle   a coded plug that must actually be fitted to the computer for the software to function. 
Software Tool	Software Tool - Software tool, also known as programming tool, is a program or application that software developers use to create, debug, or maintain other programs and applications. The term usually refers to relatively simple programs that can be combined together to accomplish a task, much as one might use multiple hand tools to fix a physical object. 
SoftwareValet	SoftwareValet - SoftwareValet is a software installer for BeOS, originally developed by Starcode Software and included with BeOS since 1998. It was originally developed for web deployment of applications, where a user would click on an 'Install with SoftwareValet' link on a website, and the BeOS web browser at the time, NetPositive, would launch SoftwareValet. 
Source Code	Source Code - Source code, just called source or code, is any series of statements written in some high level computer programming language. The term is typically used in the context of a particular piece of computer software. A computer program's source code is the collection of files that can be converted from human-readable form to an equivalent computer-executable form in machine language. The source code is either converted into an executable file by a compiler for a particular computer architecture, or executed on the fly from the human readable form with the aid of an interpreter. 
Source Code Repository	Source Code Repository - A source code repository is a place where large amounts of source code are kept, either publicly or privately. They are often used by multi-developer projects to handle various versions in which developers submit various patches of code in an organized fashion. CVS is a popular GNU project to handle these issues and is common in open source projects. 
Source Language	Source Language - Source language refers to the computer programming language in which a source program or source code is written. Source languages are classified as either high-level languages or low-level languages, according to whether each notation in the source language stands for many or only one instruction in machine code. Programs in high-level languages are translated into machine code by either a compiler or an interpreter program. Low-level programs are translated into machine code by means of an assembler program. The program, before translation, is called the source program; after translation into machine code it is called the object program. 
Source Program	Source Program - Source program refers to a program written in a source language, which is are classified as either high-level languages or low-level languages, according to whether each notation in the source language stands for many or only one instruction in machine code. Programs in high-level languages are translated into machine code by either a compiler or an interpreter program. Low-level programs are translated into machine code by means of an assembler program. The program, before translation, is called the source program; after translation into machine code it is called the object program. 
SourceForge	SourceForge - SourceForge is the world's largest Open Source software development project facilitated through a web site (SourceForge.net, owned by OSTG, Inc. (Open Source Technology Group)), hosting more than 100,000 projects and over 1,000,000 registered users with a centralized resource for managing projects, issues, communications, and code. SourceForge.net has the largest repository of Open Source code and applications available on the Internet, and hosts more Open Source development products than any other site or network worldwide. SourceForge.net provides a wide variety of servicesto projects we host, and to the Open Source community. 
SOX Unix	SOX Unix - SOX Unix(SOX) is a UNIX clone developed from scratch in Brazil in late 1980s by Computadores e Sistemas Brasileiros SA (now Cobra Tecnologia). Certified as UNIX-compatible by X/Open (through Unisoft) in early 1989, SOX was one of the first re-implementation of UNIX fully independent of AT&T that passed the X/Open verification tests, and the only one ever completed 100% outside the United States. 
SoX: Sound eXchange	SoX: Sound eXchange - Sound eXchange (SoX) is a free digital audio editor which is licensed under the GPL and distributed by Chris Bagwell through Sourceforge. SoX is written in standard C, with a command-line interface. 
Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation	Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation - Sparse conditional constant propagation is an optimization frequently utilized in compilers after conversion to static single assignment form (SSA). It simultaneously removes dead code and propagates constants throughout a program. It must be noted, however, that it is strictly more powerful than applying dead code elimination and constant propagation in any order or any number of repetitions. 
Spell Checker	Spell Checker - Spell checker is a program that checks the spelling of words in a text or other document. Spell checkers are particularly valuable for catching typos. Some spell checker comes with grammer and syntax checking too. Many word processors come with a built-in spell checker, but you can also purchase stand-alone utilities. 
Spider-Man Cartoon Maker	Spider-Man Cartoon Maker - The Spider-Man Cartoon Maker was a recreational software package that allows the user to create animations with a minimal level of sophistication by utilising a library of backdrops, animations and sound effects from the 1994 Marvel Comics television series, Spider-Man: The Animated Series. 
Spiral Model	Spiral Model - The spiral model is a software development process combining elements of both design and prototyping-in-stages, in an effort to combine advantages of top-down and bottom-up concepts. Spiral model uses the waterfall model for each step, with the aim of managing risk. In the spiral model, developers define and implement features in order of decreasing priority. 
SPOF: Single Point of Failure	SPOF: Single Point of Failure - Single point of failure(SPOF) is a generic phrase for any component of a system that upon failure will cause a malfunction in the entire system. A SPOF can be a hardware or electrical component or a software component. This can be as simple as a process failure or as catastrophic as a computer system crash. 
Spreadsheet	Spreadsheet - Spreadsheet typically refers to a table of values arranged in rows and columns. Each value can have a predefined relationship to the other values. If you change one value, therefore, you may need to change other values as well. There are many spreadsheet applications available that enable users to create and operate the data in the table efficiently. 
Spreadsheet Applications	Spreadsheet Applications - Spreadsheet applications, sometimes simply referred to as spreadsheets, are computer programs that enable user to create and manipulate spreadsheets electronically. In a spreadsheet application, each value sits in a cell. Different data types can be assigned to each cell and how different cells depend on one another. The relationships between cells are called formulas, and the names of the cells are called labels. 
Sproc: Stored Procedure	Sproc: Stored Procedure - Stored procedure, also known as sproc, is a SQL program which is physically stored within a database and executed by calling it directly from the client or from a database trigger. The exact implementation of a stored procedure varies from one database to another. In most cases however, stored procedures allow for an API to be defined for a database, rather than having a client application interact with the tables and other database objects directly. When the SQL procedure is stored in the database, it does not have to be replicated in each client. This saves programming effort especially when different client user interfaces and development systems are used. Triggers and stored procedures are built into DBMSs used in client/server environments. 
SQL: Structured Query Language	SQL: Structured Query Language - Structured query language(SQL) is an ANSI/ISO standardized query language used to create, modify, retrieve and manipulate data from relational database management systems. The original version called SEQUEL (structured English query language) was designed by an IBM research center in 1974 and 1975. SQL was first introduced as a commercial database system in 1979 by Oracle Corporation. 
SQLite	SQLite - SQLite, a public domain project, is an ACID-compliant relational database management system contained in a relatively small C library. Unlike the usual client-server paradigm, the SQLite engine is not a standalone process with which the program communicates, but is linked in and thus becomes an integral part of the program. Therefore, the primary communication protocol is direct API calls within the programming language. This can have a positive impact on the amount of overhead, latency time and overall simplicity. 
Squeez Utility	Squeez Utility - Squeez is a shareware file archiver and data compression utility by Speedproject. It supports 13 different compression algorithms. The software reads and writes files in the formats ZIP, RAR, SQX, ACE, ARJ, BZIP, GZIP, LZH, TAR, UUE, JAR, CAB and 7z. 
Squish of FidoNet	Squish of FidoNet - Squish is both the name of a FidoNet mail tossing application originally designed for DOS and OS/2, and the name of the primary mail storage format in which this application stores FidoNet and other local BBS messages. Before Squish, open storage formats for FidoNet and Bulletin Board messages were relatively slow and inefficient. 
SR: Service Release	SR: Service Release - Service Release (SR) refers to a special software release including service packs (SP) and the original product. 
Srvany	Srvany - Srvany is a Microsoft Windows 2000/2003/XP Server Resource Kit utility that can be used to enable applications to run as services. 
SSA: Static Single Assignment Form	SSA: Static Single Assignment Form - Static single assignment form (SSA form or SSA) is an intermediate representation (IR) in which every variable is assigned exactly once. Existing variables in the original IR are split into versions, new variables typically indicated by the original name with a subscript, so that every definition gets its own version. In SSA form, use-def chains are explicit and each contains a single element. 
SSADM: Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method	SSADM: Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method - Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) is a system approach to the analysis and design of information systems. SSADM was produced for the CCTA, a UK government office concerned with the use of technology in government, from 1980 onwards. The names of Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method and SSADM are now Registered Trade Marks of the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), which is an Office of the United Kingdom's Treasury. SSADM is a waterfall method by which an IS design can be arrived at; SSADM can be thought to represent a pinnacle of the rigorous document-led approach to system design, and contrastswith more contemporary Rapid Application Development methods such as DSDM. 
Stack of Data Structure	Stack of Data Structure - In computer science, a stack is a temporary abstract data type and data structure based on the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). Stacks are used extensively at every level of a modern computer system. For example, a modern PC uses stacks at the architecture level, which are used to run an operating system. The operating system also uses stacks, which are used to run a Java Virtual Machine, which is stack oriented, and the Java language itself has a class called Stack, which can be used by the programmer. The stack is ubiquitous. 
Startup Code	Startup Code - Startup code refers to a piece of assembly language code that prepares the way for software written in a high-level language. Startup code usually initializes code and data segments, safes I/O, and sets up chip selects and wait states. Most cross-compilers come with startup code that a user can modify, compile, and link with embedded programs. 
Static Class	Static Class - Static class is a concept in C# programming. Static classes and class members are used to create data and functions that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. Static class members can be used to separate data and behavior that is independent of any object identity: the data and functions do not change regardless of what happens to the object. Static classes can be used when there is no data or behavior in the class that depends on object identity. 
Static Code Analysis	Static Code Analysis - Static code analysis is a set of methods for analysing software source code or object code in an effort to gain understanding of what the software does and establish certain correctness criteria. The term is usually applied to the analysis performed by an automated tool, with human analysis being called program understanding or program comprehension. 
Static Library	Static Library - In computer science, a static library, also referred to as a statically linked library, is a computer library in which links are resolved at compile-time by a linker. Static libraries may be merged with other libraries and executables to form a single object file, or they may be loaded at runtime into the address space of the linking executable or library, at a static memory offset determined at link-time. 
STL: Standard Template Library	STL: Standard Template Library - The Standard Template Library (STL) is a C++ library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators; it provides many of the basic algorithms and data structures of computer science. The STL is a generic library, meaning that its components are heavily parameterized: almost every component in the STL is a template. STL was developed by Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee at Hewlett-Packard. It is based on their research in the field of generic programming. 
Strength Reduction	Strength Reduction - Strength reduction is a compiler optimization where a function of some systematically changing variable is calculated more efficiently by using previous values of the function. In a procedural programming language this would apply to an expression involving a loop variable and in a declarative language it would apply to the argument of a recursive function. 
String Intern Pool	String Intern Pool - In some modern programming languages, including Java and C#, the string intern pool is a data structure managed internally by the platform or virtual machine to facilitate efficient implementation of certain string processing tasks. The pool contains a single copy (called the intern) of each distinct string that is currently represented by a string object in the system. By invoking a method of the string class (for example String.intern() in Java), the programmer has access to this unique string object. 
Structured Analysis	Structured Analysis - Structured analysis is one of requirements analysis methods used in software engineering. Structure analysis includes a few approaches: 1) Data Flow Diagrams to show information flow and processing in a system. 2) Structure Charts show module structure and calling relationships. 3) State models include diagrams and tables that show the significant states in a system, events that cause transitions between states and the actions that result. 4) Task diagrams show threads of execution and the real-time operating system services like queues, event flags and semaphores that connect them in a multi-tasking environment. 
Structured Design	Structured Design - Structured design is one of systematic top-down design techniques used in software engineering, usually after structured analysis. The goal of structured design is to produce design specifcations of a system, based on the system requirements generated from the structured analysis. 
Structured Programming	Structured Programming - Structured programming refers to a software development technique that includes structured analysis and design and results in the development of a structured program. Structured programming can be seen as a subset or subdiscipline of procedural programming, one of the major programming paradigms. 
StuffIt Expander	StuffIt Expander - StuffIt Expander, published by Aladdin Systems, is program for the Macintosh used to decompress files after downloading and makes them usable by your computer. StuffIt Expander is similar to an unzipping program in a PC. 
Subversion	Subversion - Subversion is an open source application used for revision control. It is sometimes abbreviated to svn in reference to the name of its command line interface. Subversion is designed specifically to be a modern replacement for Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and shares a number of the same key developers. 
Subweb	Subweb - Subweb, a term introduced by Microsoft, refers to certain portion of a website that has special style and restrictions when access. There is a feature within FrontPage that allows a section (contained within a folder, or directory) to be converted into a website in its own right. It is not seen as another site by the server, however, and so is known as a subweb of the current website. If you have the parent web open in FrontPage and click to go into the subweb, FrontPage opens it in a new window, strengthening the impression that you are dealing with a separate entity. In the new window, you can treat the subweb as though it was a separate website with its own theme, etc.. 
SuperCollider Programming Language	SuperCollider Programming Language - SuperCollider, released in 2002 by its author, James McCartney, under the free software GPL license, is a real time audio synthesis programming language. Since then it has been evolving into a system used and further developed by both scientists and artists working with sound. It is an efficient and expressive dynamic programming language which makes it an interesting framework for acoustic research, algorithmic music and interactive programming. 
SVK	SVK - SVK is a decentralized version control system written in Perl, with a design comparable to BitKeeper and GNU arch. The primary author of svk is Chia-liang Kao, and it is distributed under Perl's Artistic License as well as GPL. 
Sweep Software	Sweep Software - Sweep is an open source, multiplatform digital audio editor and live playback tool for GNU/Linux, BSD and compatible systems. It is able to handle many sound formats, including MP3, WAV and Vorbis. The most notable feature of Sweep is its stylus-like cursor tool called Scrubby.The program is licensed under the GPL and it is included in most modern Linux distributions. 
Sybase SQL Server	Sybase SQL Server - Sybase SQL Server, a relational database management system of Sybase Corporation, was originally created for UNIX platforms in 1987. In 1988, SQL Server for OS/2 was co-developed for the PC by Sybase, Microsoft, and Ashton-Tate. In 1995, Sybase released SQL Server 11. 
Symbolic Inference	Symbolic Inference - Symbolic inference refers to the derivation of new facts from known facts and inference rules. This is one of the fundamental operations of artificial intelligence and logic programming languages like Prolog. 
Syntax	Syntax - Syntax, in computer science, refers to the spelling and grammar of a programming language. Computers are inflexible machines that understand what you type only if you type it in the exact form or sytax that the computer expects. Each program defines its own syntactical rules that control which words the computer understands, which combinations of words are meaningful, and what punctuation is necessary. The analysis of a program's syntax is usually performed using an automatically generated program known as a parser which often builds an abstract syntax tree. 
Sysadmin: System Administrator	Sysadmin: System Administrator - A system administrator, or sysadmin, is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system or network for a company or other organization. System administrators are often members of an information technology department. 
System Call	System Call - System call is the mechanism used by an application program to request service from the operating system or more specifically, the operating system kernel. System calls often use a special CPU instruction which causes the processor to transfer control to more privileged code, as previously specified by the more privileged code. This allows the more privileged code to specify where it will be entered as well as important processor state at the time of entry. When the system call is invoked, the program which invoked it is interrupted, and information needed to continue its execution later is saved. The processor then begins executing the higher privileged code, which, by examining processor state set by the less privileged code and/or its stack, determines what is being requested. When it is finished, it returns to the program, restoring the saved state, and the program continues executing. 
System Integrator	System Integrator - System integrator is a person or company that specializes in integrating systems. System integrators may work in many fields. In Information Technology (IT), system integrators integrate multiple systems for inputting, processing, interpreting, storing, and categorizing data. For example, a system integrator may build an IT solution integrating an Oracle based inventory tracking system, an OnBase document management system, a Microsoft CRM system, a group of Panasonic scanners, and a Rimage storage system to produce an overall solution for the customer. 
System Resource	System Resource - System Resource refers to the tools, typically part of an OS, used by either hardware or software to communicate with each other, for example, to alert software of a need or by software to control a function of hardware. In the Windows operating system, there are two kinds system resources: User Resources, and GDI (Graphic Device Interface) Resources. The User component manages input from the keyboard, mouse, and other input devices and output to the user interface (windows, icons, menus, and so on). It also manages interaction with the sound driver, timer, and communications ports. The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is the graphical system that manages what appears on the screen. It also provides graphics support for printers and other output devices. It draws graphic primitives, manipulates bitmaps, and interacts with device-independent graphics drivers, including those for display and printer output device drivers. 
System Software	System Software - System software, also known as system program, is a type of software which includes the operating system and all utility programs that manage computer resources at a low level.

TinyOS is an embedded operating system, written in NesC programming language, as a set of cooperating tasks and processes. It is designed to be able to incorporate rapid innovation as well as to operate within the severe memory constraints inherent in sensor networks. It is intended to be incorporated into smartdust. 
Top-Down Design	Top-Down Design - Top-down design, in contrast to the bottom-up design, is one of the software design strategies. In the top-down design approach, an overview of the system is formulated, without going into detail for any part of it. Each part of the system is then refined by designing it in more details. Each new part may then be refined again, defining it in yet more details until the entire specification is detailed enough to validate the model. The top-down model is often designed with the assistance of dark boxes that make it easier to bring to fulfillment but insufficient and irrelevant in understanding the elementary mechanisms. This approach to software design probably originated at IBM, and grew out of structured programming practices. 
TOS: Tape Operating System	TOS: Tape Operating System - Tape Operating System (TOS) is was an IBM operating system for the System 360, used in the early days around 1965 to support the IBM 360 model 30 and similar platforms. TOS was a predecessor to IBM's Disk Operating System.

This range included the 520ST, 1040ST and the F, FM and E variations (e.g.1040STE). Later, 32-bit machines (TT, Falcon030) were developed using a new version of TOS, called MultiTOS, which was based on MiNT. 
Trace Scheduling	Trace Scheduling - Trace scheduling is an optimization technique used in compilers for computer programs. Trace scheduling was originally developed for Very Long Instruction Word, or VLIW machines, and is a form of global code motion. It works by converting a loop to long straight-line code sequence using loop unrolling and static branch prediction. This process separates out unlikely code and add handlers for exits from trace. The goal is to have the most common case executed as a sequential set of instructions without branches. 
Trial Software	Trial Software - Trial software refers to software which consumers can try before they buy. Trial versions of software usually contain all the functionality of the regular version, but can only be used for a limited time. 
Trigger	Trigger - Trigger, generally speaking, is the cause of an event. In a database management system (DBMS), a trigger is an SQL procedure that is executed when a record is added or deleted. It is used to maintain referential integrity in the database. A trigger may also execute a stored procedure. Triggers and stored procedures are built into DBMSs used in client/server environments. 
TrueSpace	TrueSpace - trueSpace is a 3D computer graphics and animation software developed by Caligari Corporation, originally created for the Amiga Computer, and later for the Windows platform.One of the most distinctive features of TrueSpace is its interface, using mainly 3D widgets for most common editing operations.

It was a part of Borland's highly popular family of compilers including Turbo Pascal, Turbo Basic, Turbo Prolog and Turbo C. Turbo C++ was a successor of Turbo C, expanding the compiler similarly to how Turbo Pascal 5.5 added object functionality to the earlier Turbo Pascal versions. Unlike Turbo Pascal, however, Turbo C++ always adhered to C++ language standards of its time. It has never been capable of compiling ISO-standard C++, however. 
Turbo Pascal	Turbo Pascal - Turbo Pascal is a compiler and a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Pascal programming language running mainly on MS-DOS, developed by Borland. The name Borland Pascal was generally reserved for the high end packages (with more libraries and standard library source code) whilst the original cheap and widely known version was sold as Turbo Pascal. The name Borland Pascal is also used more generically for Borland's dialect of Pascal. Borland has released three versions of Turbo Pascal for free: versions 1.0, 3.02 and 5.5.

UML is a general-purpose modeling language that includes a standardized graphical notation that may be used to create an abstract model of a system, sometimes referred to as the UML model. UML may be considered as an extensible modeling language since it offers a profile mechanism to customize the language. If a concept you need is not present in the base language, you may introduce it by defining a stereotype. 
Unix	Unix - Unix (or UNIX) is a computer operating system originally developed in the 1960s and 1970s by AT&T Bell Labs. Today Unix is split into various branches, developed over time by many companies and non-profit organizations, such as contributors to the GNU project. The present owner of the UNIX trademark is The Open Group, while the present claimants on the rights to the UNIX source code are SCO Group and Novell. The UNIX operating system was designed to let multiple users access the computer at the same time and share its resources. While initially designed for medium-sized minicomputers, the operating system was soon moved to larger, more powerful mainframe computers. As personal computers grew in popularity, versions of UNIX found their way into these boxes, and a number of companies produce UNIX-based machines forthe scientific and programming communities. 
Unreachable Code	Unreachable Code - In computer programming, unreachable code, also known as dead code, typically consists of blocks of programming instructions or entire routines that will never be accessed because all calls to them have been removed, or code that cannot be reached for some reason. Dead code is undesirable for a number of reasons, but primarily because it suggests there is a fault in the software. Detecting dead code is a form of static analysis and involves performing control flow analysis to find any code that will never be executed regardless of the values of variables and other conditions at run time. 
Upgrade	Upgrade - An upgrade, in computer industry, refers to a new version of a software or hardware product designed to replace an older version of the same product. Sometimes, upgrade means a better version such as a professional version with more functionalities and better performance to replace a lighter version of the same product.

Unlike more popular debugger stacks for these platforms, ups is completely self-contained not merely a graphical front-end to lower-level debuggers like gdb (although some work has been done to make ups usable in that way). The ups user interface is built directly upon the X Window System and SunView, i.e. it does not use an intermediate toolkit such as Motif or GTK+. 
Upward Compatible	Upward Compatible - Upward compatible, also known as forward compatible, refers to software that runs not only on the computer for which it was designed, but also on newer and more powerful models. Upward compatibility is important because it means you can move to a newer, larger, and more sophisticated computer without converting your data. An example of upward/forward compatibility is the specification that a web browser ignore HTML tags not recognised. Ignoring data or application instructions not recognized is the typical behavior of forward compatible systems. 
USG Unix: Unix Support Group	USG Unix: Unix Support Group - Unix Support Group(USG) Unix refers to AT&T Unix commercial versions after Version 7, especially System III and System V releases 1, 2, and 3. So called because during most of the lifespan of those versions AT&T's support crew was called the Unix Support Group. 
User Interface	User Interface - The user interface is the aggregate of means by which people (the users) interact with a particular machine, device, computer program or other complex tool (the system). The user interface provides two critical functions: Input, allowing the users to manipulate the system, and Output, allowing the system to produce the effects of the users' manipulation. There are many types of user interfaces, such as GUI, Command Line, Web-based user interfaces, and touch interface, etc.

Windows 2003	Windows 2003 - Windows Server 2003 is part of the Microsoft Windows operating systems released in the year of 2003 as the successor to Windows 2000 Server. Windows Server 2003 incorporated compatibility and other features from Windows 2000 and XP. Unlike Windows 2000 Server, Windows Server 2003's default installation has none of the server components enabled, to reduce the attack surface of new machines. Windows Server 2003 includes compatibility modes to allow older applications to run with greater stability. It was made more compatible with Windows NT 4.0 domain-based networking. Incorporating and upgrading a Windows NT 4.0 domain to Windows 2000 was considered difficult and time consuming, and generally was considered an all or nothing upgrade particularly when dealing with Active Directory. Windows Server 2003 brought in enhanced Active Directory compatibility, and better deployment support, to ease the transition from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional. 
Windows 3.0	Windows 3.0 - Windows 3.0 was the third major release of Microsoft Windows, and came out on May 22, 1990. It became the first widely successful version of Windows and a powerful rival to Apple Macintosh and the Commodore Amiga on the GUI front. Windows 3.0 succeeded Windows 2.1x and included a significantly revamped user interface as well as technical improvements to make better use of the memory management capabilities of Intel's 80286 and 80386 processors. 
Windows 3.1x	Windows 3.1x - The Windows 3.1x family of Microsoft Windows operating systems were released from 1992 to 1994, succeeding Windows 3.0. This family of Windows could run in either Standard or 386 Enhanced memory modes. The exception was Windows for Workgroups 3.11, which could only run in 386 Enhanced mode. 
Windows 95	Windows 95 - Windows 95 is a consumer-oriented GUI-based operating system released in 1995 by Microsoft, and was a significant progression from the company's previous versions of Windows. Windows 95 was intended to combine the functions of Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. It featured significant improvements over the popular Windows 3.1, most visibly the graphical user interface (GUI) whose basic format and structure is still used today in Windows XP. There were also large changes to the underlying workings, including support for 255-character mixed-case long filenames and preemptively multitasked protected-mode 32-bit applications. 
Windows 98	Windows 98 - Windows 98 is a graphical operating system released in 1998 by Microsoft. The new operating system was essentially an updated version of Windows 95, and like that earlier version, it was a hybrid 16-bit/32-bit monolithic product. Among its features were better AGP support, functional USB drivers, and support for multiple monitors and WebTV. Also added was support for the FAT32 file system which allowed Windows 98 support disk partitions larger than the two gigabyte maximum accepted by Windows 95. As in later releases of Windows 95, Internet Explorer continued to be integrated into the Windows Explorer interface. It was also the first version of Windows to support ACPI. 
Windows API	Windows API - The Windows API refers to the core set of application programming interfaces available in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. It is designed for usage by C/C++ programs and is the most direct way to interact with a Windows system for software applications. Lower level access to a Windows system, mostly required for device drivers, is provided by the Native API in current versions of Windows. 
Windows Forms	Windows Forms - Windows Forms refers to the GUI portion of the Microsoft .NET development framework, providing access to the native Windows widgets by wrapping the existing Win32 API in managed code. 
Windows NT	Windows NT - Windows NT, where NT means New Technology, is a family of Microsoft's 32-bit operating system first released in July 1993 and Windows NT 3.1. NT was designed for high end workstations and servers. It was originally designed to be a powerful high-level language-based processor-independent multiprocessing multiuser operating system with features comparable to Unix to complement workstation versions of Windows that were based on MS-DOS until 2001. It was the first 32-bit version of Windows. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are the latest versions of Windows NT. 
Windows Server System	Windows Server System - Windows Server System is an integrated set of server software from Microsoft. It forms the infrastructure for operating the back end of an information technology system. Microsoft divides its server offerings into four major categories: Security, IT Operations, Applications, and Collaboration. Many of the products integrate deeply with Visual Studio to help software developers and designers build solutions using familiar tools. 
Windows XP	Windows XP - Windows XP is a line of operating systems developed by Microsoft for use on general-purpose computer systems, including home and business desktops, notebook computers, and media centers. Windows XP is the successor to both Windows 2000 and Windows Me, and is the first consumer-oriented operating system produced by Microsoft to be built on the Windows NT kernel and architecture. With the release of Windows XP, the Windows 95/98 architecture was finally discontinued. Windows XP was first released on October 25, 2001. 
Wine Software	Wine Software - WINE Software, a free software released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), allows a PC running a Unix-like operating system and the X Window System to execute programs originally written for Microsoft Windows. Alternately, those wishing to port a Windows application to a Unix-like system can compile it against the Wine libraries. The name 'Wine'derives from the recursive acronym Wine Is Not an Emulator, or WINdows Emulator. While the name sometimes appears in the forms WINE and wine, the project developers have agreed to standardize on the form Wine. 
WinG	WinG - WinG is an API to provide fast graphics performance on Windows 3.1. It was later built-in to Windows 95. In Win32, the equivalent of WinG functionality is provided via API calls such as CreateDIBSection(), SetDIBColorTable(), BitBlt(), and StretchBlt().

Wings 3D is available for most platforms, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, using the Erlang environment.Wings 3D is best suited for modelling and texturing low-polygon meshes, towards which its interface is geared. When compared to other open-source modelling programs such as Blender, its GUI is minimalistic. 
Winny Program	Winny Program - Winny, also known as WinNY, is a Japanese peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing program similar to Freenet that claims to keep user identities untraceable. While Freenet was implemented in Java, Winny was implemented as a Windows C++ application. The software takes its name from WinMX, which is a peer-to-peer file sharing program authored by Frontcode Technologies and running on Windows operating systems. 
WinRAR	WinRAR - WinRAR is a shareware file archiver and data compression utility by Eugene Roshal. It is one of the few applications that are able to create RAR archives natively, as the encoding method is held to be proprietary. 
WinZip	WinZip - WinZip is a program to uncompress files after downloading them on a PC running Microsoft Windows. Many files are stored on servers in a compressed format, making them take up less disk space, and reducing the time it takes for you to download them. WinZip decompresses these files, and makes them usable by the computer. 
Word Processing	Word Processing - Word processing refers to the process of using a computer to create, edit, format and print documents. To perform word processing, a special program called a word processor is required, which enables you to create a document, store it electronically on a disk, display it on a screen, modify it by entering commands and characters from the keyboard, and print it on a printer. 
Word Processor	Word Processor - Word processor is computer program that enables you to perform word processing functions such as creating, editing, formating and printing documents. 
Wrapper Software	Wrapper Software - Wrapper software refers to a type of software that accompanies resources or other software for the purposes of improving convenience, compatibility, or security. For example, a wrapper is used to compress and encrypt software that is being sold over the Internet. 
WWIV BBS	WWIV BBS - The WWIV Bulletin Board System (BBS) was one of the most popular dialup computer hosting systems in the online world during the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of its most unusual features was a proprietary networking system, allowing tens of thousands of systems running the software to link themselves together into various networks, much like FidoNet.This software started out as a single BBS in St. Louis, MO, run by Wayne Bell, who wrote it in BASIC. 
WxWidgets	WxWidgets - wxWidgets, formerly known as wxWindows, is an open source, cross-platform widget toolkit; that is, a library of basic elements for building a graphical user interface (GUI).

It provides the standard toolkit and protocol to build graphical user interfaces (GUI) on Unix, Unix-like operating systems, and OpenVMS   almost all modern operating systems support it. X provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving windows on the screen and interacting with a mouse and/or keyboard. 
X.Org Fundation	X.Org Fundation - The X.Org Foundation is an not-for-profit organization for the development of the X Window System. It was founded on 22 January 2004. The creation of the Foundation marked a radical change in the governance of X. Whereas the stewards of X since 1988 (including the previous X.Org) had been vendor organizations, X.Org is led by software developers and using community development on the bazaar model, which relies on outside involvement. Membership is also open to individuals, with corporate membership being in the form of sponsorship. 
X.Org Server	X.Org Server - X.Org Server, the X.Org Foundation Open Source Public Implementation of X11, is the official reference implementation of the X Window System, commonly used on Linux and UNIX. It is both open source and free software. The project is run by the X.Org Foundation and is hosted by freedesktop.org. X11R6.7.0, the first version of the X.Org Server, was forked from XFree86 4.4 RC2. 
X/Open	X/Open - X/Open Company, Ltd. was a consortium founded by several European UNIX systems manufacturers in 1984 to identify and promote open standards in the field of information technology. X/Open managed the UNIX trademark from 1993 to 1996, when it merged with the Open Software Foundation to form The Open Group. 
XAD	XAD - The XAD system is a open source client based archiving and unarchiving system. There is a master library called xadmaster.library which provides an interface between the client and the user application and there are clients handling the special archive formats. Three different types to handle file and disk archives and also disk image files (filesystem) are possible. They can be made by everyone. The master library itself includes some of these clients internally to make the work somewhat easier for the package maintainer and the user installing it. 
XCMD: eXternal CoMmanD	XCMD: eXternal CoMmanD - eXternal CoMmanD(XCMD) is plugin protocol of HyperTalk which allows a user to develope HyperTalk command written in a language such as C or Pascal. XCMD is native code containers attached to stacks (as Macintosh-specific resources) with a single entry point and return value. XCMDs and XFCNs could be called just like regular message and function handlers from HyperTalk scripts, and were also able to send messages back to the HyperCard application. Some enterprising XCMD authors added advanced features like full color support (ColorizeHC, HyperTint, AddColor), multiple special-purpose windows (Prompt, Tabloid, Textoid, Listoid, ShowDialog, MegaWindows), drag and drop support and various hardware interfaces to the language. 
Xcode	Xcode - Xcode is Apple Computer's integrated development environment (IDE) for developing applications and other software for Mac OS X. It is shipped free with Mac OS X. First introduced on October 24, 2003 along with the release of Mac OS X v10.3, it extended and replaced Apple's earlier IDE, Project Builder, which was inherited from NeXT. 
XDBX	XDBX - xdbx is a graphical user interface to the dbx debugger under the X Window System. It provides visual feedback and mouse input for the user to control program execution through breakpoints, to examine and traverse the function call stack, to display values of variables and data structures, and to browse source files and functions. This program is old and is not being actively maintained. 
XDM: X Window Display Manager	XDM: X Window Display Manager - X Window Display Manager(XDM) is the default display manager for the X Window System. It is a bare-bones X display manager. It was introduced with X11 Release 3 in October 1988, to support the standalone X terminals that were just coming onto the market. It was written by Keith Packard. Because of its lack of configurability, users of GNOME, KDE or Enlightenment tend to use other managers such as GDM, KDM or Entrance instead of XDM. 
Xerox Development Environment	Xerox Development Environment - The Xerox Development Environment was one of the first Integrated Development Environments (IDE). It was first implemented on the Xerox Alto in 1977. 
Xerox PARC: Xerox Palo Alto Research Center	Xerox PARC: Xerox Palo Alto Research Center - Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) was a flagship research division of the Xerox Corporation, based in Palo Alto, California, USA. It was founded in 1970, and spun out as a separate company wholly owned by Xerox in 2002. It is best known for essentially creating the modern personal computer graphical user interface (GUI) paradigm. From the early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an astonishing volume of ground-breaking hardware and software innovations. The modern mice, windows, and icons (WIMP) style of software interface was invented there. So was the laser printer and the local-area network; Smalltalk; and PARC's series of D machines anticipated the powerful personal computers of the 1980s by a decade. Sadly, the prophets at PARC were without honour in their own company, so much so that it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a place that specialised in developing brilliant ideas for everyone else. 
XFCN: External Functions	XFCN: External Functions - External Functions (XFCN) is a plugin protocol of HyperTalk, which is native code containers attached to stacks (as Macintosh-specific resources) with a single entry point and return value. XFCNs could be called just like regular message and function handlers from HyperTalk scripts, and were also able to send messages back to the HyperCard application. 
XFree86	XFree86 - XFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System. It was originally written for Unix-like operating systems on IBM PC compatibles and is now available for many other operating systems and platforms. It is free and open source software under the XFree86 License version 1.1. It is developed by the XFree86 Project, Inc. XFree86 consists of client libraries used to write X applications (clients), and an X server responsible for the display. Clients and servers communicate via the X protocol, which allows them to run on different computers. 
X-Men Cartoon Maker	X-Men Cartoon Maker - The X-Men Cartoon Maker was a recreational software package that allows the user to create animations with a minimal level of sophistication by utilising a library of backdrops, animations and sound effects from the 1992 Marvel Comics television series, X-Men: The Animated Series. 
XML Schema	XML Schema - XML Schema, published as a W3C Recommendation in May 2001, is one of several XML schema languages. It was the first separate schema language for XML to achieve Recommendation status by the W3C. XML Schema can be used to express a schema: a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered 'valid' according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XML Schema was also designed with the intent of validation resulting in a collection of information adhering to specific datatypes, which can be useful in the development of XML document processing software, but which has also provoked criticism. 
XMLBeans	XMLBeans - XMLBeans is a Java-to-XML binding framework which is part of the Apache Software Foundation XML project. XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a Java friendly way. Using XMLBeans, you can take advantage of the richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data. 
XMLTerm	XMLTerm - XMLterm, stands for ``experimental Mozilla terminal, is a terminal program. XMLterm adds hypertext and graphical capabilities to the Xterm interface through the use of the extensible markup language (XML). XMLterm is open source software and is implemented using the open source Mozilla component libraries. XMLTerm is both a command line terminal, like an Xterm, and also a web page, like the one displayed by the browser. 
XMMS: X Multimedia System	XMMS: X Multimedia System - The X Multimedia System (XMMS) is a free audio player very similar to Winamp, that runs on many Unix-like operating systems. 
XMMS2: Cross Platform Music Multiplexing System	XMMS2: Cross Platform Music Multiplexing System - Cross platform music multiplexing system(XMMS2) is a new generation of the XMMS audio player. It is a new design, written from scratch, separate from the XMMS codebase. While Peter Alm, one of the original authors of XMMS, was responsible for the initial design and coding of XMMS2 (late 2002 to early 2003), he has since passed on the responsibility of furthering the project to Tobias Rundstrm and Anders Gustafsson. 
XOTcl	XOTcl - XOTcl, similar to Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), is an object-oriented extension for the Tool Command Language created by G. Neumann and U. Zdun. It supports metaclasses. Class and method definitions are completely dynamic. 
XPCOM: Cross Platform Component Object Model	XPCOM: Cross Platform Component Object Model - Cross Platform Component Object Model(XPCOM) is a simple, cross platform component model similar to CORBA or Microsoft COM. It has multiple language bindings and IDL descriptions so programmers can plug their custom functionality into the framework and connect it with other components. 
Xterm	Xterm - In Unix computing, Xterm is the standard terminal emulator for the X Window System. Xterm was originally written as a stand-alone terminal emulator for the VAXStation 100 (VS100) by Mark Vandevoorde, prior to the X Window System. A user can have many different invocations of xterm running at once on the same display, each of which provides independent input/output for the process running in it (normally the process is a Unix shell). 
XView	XView - XView is a widget toolkit from Sun Microsystems introduced in 1988, providing an OPEN LOOK user interface for X Window System applications. It has the same look and feel of the earlier SunView system, and provides a similar object-oriented application programming interface for the C programming language. 
Xxgdb	Xxgdb - Xxgdb is an open-source X Window System front-end for GNU Debugger (GDB). It was adapted from xdbx, which uses the dbx debugger.
Y Windows	Y Windows - The Y Windows, also known as Y Window System, is a windowing system, consisting of a window server and a client library for writing applications, written by Mark Thomas. It is intended to be a successor to the X Window System. It differs from the X Window System in having an integrated widget set and ground-up support for things like an alpha channel, which allows transparent or translucent windows. 
Yacc: Yet Another Compiler Compiler	Yacc: Yet Another Compiler Compiler - Yacc, abbreviated from Yet Another Compiler Compiler, is a Unix system tool program for generating C or C++ code for a parser. Yacc is a command-line tool that accepts a grammar description (in a text file) as input and generates the code for a parser for that grammar as output. Parsers are useful in many systems other than just compilers, such as for reading the contents of a configuration file stored in a system's flash memory. Yacc was developed by Stephen C. Johnson at AT&T for the Unix operating system. Later compatible programs were written, such as Berkeley Yacc, GNU bison, MKS yacc and Abraxas yacc. Each offers slight improvements and additional features over the original Yacc, but the concept has remained the same. Yacc has also been rewritten for other languages, including Ratfor, EFL, ML, Ada, Java, and Limbo. 
YafRay: Yet Another Free Raytracer	YafRay: Yet Another Free Raytracer - YafRay, abbreviated from Yet Another Free Raytracer, is an open source ray tracing program that uses an XML scene description language. It has recently been integrated into, and is often used to render scenes made in, the 3D modelling software Blender.
Z88DK	Z88DK - Z88DK is a Small-C-derived cross compiler for a long list of Z80 based computers. The name derives for that it was originally developed to target the Cambridge Z88. Z88DK is much developed from Small-C and accepts many features of ANSI C with the notable exception of multi-dimensional arrays and function pointers. 
ZIP File Format	ZIP File Format - The ZIP file format is a popular data compression and archival format. A ZIP file contains one or more files that have been compressed or stored. The ZIP format was originally designed by Phil Katz for PKZIP. However, many software utilities other than PKZIP itself are now available to create, modify or open ZIP files, notably WinZip, BOMArchiveHelper, PicoZip, Info-ZIP, WinRAR, IZArc and 7-Zip. ZIP files generally use the file extensions .zip or .ZIP and the MIME media type application/zip. 
ZipGenius	ZipGenius - ZipGenius' is a freeware file archiver designed for Microsoft Windows users, developed by M.Dev Software. It uses eg. 7-Zip format, and can also handle a number of other archive formats. It is a freeware product and is presented in two editions: STANDARD and SUITE. While the suite edition includes optional modules of the ZipGenius project (oriented to experts and power-users), the standard setup package simply includes the main ZipGenius application. 
Zipping	Zipping - Zipping refers to the process of compressing a file so it takes up less space. The compress files after zipping is called a zip file. There are two types of Zip files, normal (requiring a program to extract them) and self-executing that open up automatically. PKZip and WinZip are popular zipping and unzipping programs. 
Zlib	Zlib - zlib is an open-source, cross-platform data compression library. It was created by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler as a general-purpose abstraction of the DEFLATE compression algorithm used in their gzip file compression program.
